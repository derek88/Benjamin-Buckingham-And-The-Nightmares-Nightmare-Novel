He couldn&rsquo;t hear his shipmates but he could see them moving about as they ventured forward. The stegosaurus steered to the right as fast as he could steer and the tyrannosaurus rex held onto the sail as tightly as he could and the triceratops bailed buckets of water back into the ocean and the brontosaurus stood at the front and yelled how far they were from land. Benjamin&rsquo;s heart raced as he held tightly to his binoculars. This was definitely turning into his best dream of the year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brontosaurus let out a booming roar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Iceberg!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled. &ldquo;Go around it, stegosaurus! Go around!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stegosaurus turned quickly and violently. The tyrannosaurus rex fell into the mountainous waves of the ocean followed by the triceratops, stegosaurus, brontosaurus, and, finally, Benjamin who crashed to the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Buckingham stood at the entrance to Benjamin&rsquo;s door with her hands on her hips. She looked as if she had seen her nine year-old boy do this hundreds of mornings, because this happened almost every morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, time to wake up,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham said to Benjamin who had fallen to the ground, his pillows and blankets strewn across him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, it was amazing!&rdquo; Benjamin began as he leaped to his feet. &ldquo;The dinosaurs and I were only a mile away from destroying Professor Undutois&rsquo; lair and then a big storm came in and we had to survive. We steered the ship straight and we were going to make it but then the stegosaurus moved us too quickly. We were so close!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin waved his arms back and forth as he moved throughout his room, almost knocking over the dinosaur posters that lined his walls and the dinosaur figurines that sat upon his dresser.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The stegosaurus always seems to ruin it for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Benjamin said as he stopped in front of his stegosaurus alarm clock. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why he can&rsquo;t just steer like the brontosaurus can steer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe you should tell the stegosaurus not to overdo it next time he has to steer through the storm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Or, maybe I could go back to sleep and I&rsquo;ll give him the instructions now,&rdquo; Benjamin suggested before he jumped back into bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Buckingham gave Benjamin a disapproving look and cleared her throat once, which alerted Benjamin to her serious tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have a doctor&rsquo;s appointment this morning,&rdquo; she reminded Benjamin. &ldquo;Get dressed because we&rsquo;re going to be late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On any other day, Benjamin would not have been excited about going to the doctor&rsquo;s office. But on that day, Benjamin&rsquo;s life could change. And, not only could it change. It could change for the better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paced back and forth in Dr. Ogar Connolley&rsquo;s examination room while his mother read an old nature magazine that had been read by many other mothers. The pacing was disturbing Mrs. Buckingham, mostly because Benjamin&rsquo;s nervousness and restlessness was starting to make his mother nervous and restless. He could not help it, though. He needed Dr. Connolley to tell him what he had been hoping to hear all year long. He wanted to know that he is average for his age. Average in height, average in weight, average in seeing, average in not cleaning after himself, average in supernatural powers was all that he wanted. During each of the previous eight doctor&rsquo;s appointments, Benjamin had been told that he was, sadly, below average.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorknob started to turn and Benjamin released all of his anticipation at once. Mrs. Buckingham also jumped and the nature magazine flew across the room into a picture of an ankle. The door opened slowly for Benjamin, his eyes as wide as his ears were open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin&rsquo;s mind raced with thoughts as to what it would be like to be average. He did not bother to imagine what it would be like to be above average. That would be a dream even his creative mind could not fathom. Being average would mean that he could finally blend in with everyone else at school. Being average would mean that he could finally act like everyone else his age. Being average would mean he would no longer stick out of the crowd. Being average would make him happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Connolley&#39;s tall, skinny figure entered the room, his grey, wiry hair pointing every direction and his thick glasses almost hiding his tiny eyes. Dr. Connolley took Benjamin&rsquo;s chart and uttered some &ldquo;ahh,&rdquo; &ldquo;ooo,&rdquo; &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; &ldquo;interesting,&rdquo; and other noises that Benjamin could not interpret as either positive or negative. He placed the papers back on the table and crossed his hands in front of Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are perfectly healthy, Benjamin,&rdquo; Dr. Connolley said with a smile more round than his balding head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s great to hear, Dr. Connolley,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham said as she stood from her chair to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you again next year,&rdquo; Dr. Connolley offered as he patted Benjamin on the head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not the information Benjamin wanted to hear. He did not want to know if he was healthy. Healthy was not nearly as important to him as knowing how he compared to all of the other children in his class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Am I average?&rdquo; Benjamin asked earnestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Benjamin,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham began. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly healthy so we can get you off to school. We don&rsquo;t want you to be late for school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, but it should be in the chart,&rdquo; Benjamin pointed to the papers on the table. &ldquo;Am I average?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Dr. Connolley offered an expression that gave Benjamin the complete answer. Dr. Connolley tightened his lips. This was not a positive expression. Benjamin&rsquo;s stomach felt weak and he threw his hands into the air before falling onto his back on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He is very healthy,&rdquo; Dr. Connolley said to Mrs. Buckingham.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m below-average,&rdquo; Benjamin sulked while on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re below-average right now, &ldquo;Dr. Connolley added. &ldquo;Next year, you could be above-average. You could grow a lot in a year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin groaned. He could not wait a year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin continued groaning the entire ride to school. He had planned to tell everyone that he was average. Now, he had to make sure no one knew that he was still below average.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news reporter on the radio was going on and on about the story of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;People everywhere appear to be dreaming less, according to a recent story,&rdquo; said the news reporter. &ldquo;Dreams are in decline and are showing no signs of improvement. This is a reflection of our point in history where--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think you are over exaggerating things a little bit,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham said as she stopped her baby blue car in front of the school&rsquo;s entrance. &ldquo;Some people take a little longer than other people to grow. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. You just have to be a little patient.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin groaned loudly as he swung his dinosaur backpack onto his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have a great day at school!&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham yelled to Benjamin as he sulked towards the entrance. Every step felt like an eternity, like an unbelievable amount of exertion needed. Benjamin groaned loudly as he strained to open the door that only yesterday could have been opened with ease. One year, he thought to himself. How many more years of being below average would he have to endure.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Mr. Arnold Marchetta stood at the front of the class with a globe in one hand and a blue marker in the other. He was not the best teacher that Benjamin had and he was arguably the worst. Mr. Marchetta was very good at keeping his desk clean and his space organized. He was not, however, very good at keeping his classroom clean or his students organized. While Mr. Marchetta brushed the dust from his tie and shoes, Benjamin&rsquo;s classmates would throw things back and forth.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin!&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta yelled at the classroom with his shrill, nasal voice. &ldquo;Did you throw something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Benjamin replied quickly because it was the truth.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he always says,&rdquo; Howard Horne snickered from the back of the room.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;But, I didn&rsquo;t. I never do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;Then who did, Benjamin?&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin thought about how he could answer this question. If he said that Howard did it, Howard would seek revenge at a later time. And if Mr. Marchetta did not believe Benjamin, he would be in even more trouble. Benjamin did not know how to escape this situation. He gazed into the black dots in the ceiling and wondered if Mr. Marchetta would be picking on him if he was not so small.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Benjamin said quietly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t know and no one else seems to know, I&rsquo;d say that you&rsquo;re hiding something,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta continued. &ldquo;Is there something like you&rsquo;d like to share with the class?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin thought that Mr. Marchetta was going to tell everyone the results of his doctor&rsquo;s appointment. No one must know, Benjamin thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Well in that case, you&rsquo;re going to sit next to me for the remainder of the day,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta continued as Benjamin&rsquo;s classmates laughed.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>This was not the first time that Benjamin had been punished by having to sit next to Mr. Marchetta. Benjamin knew that his teacher was only picking on him because Howard Horne was bigger than everyone else in class, including the teacher. No one wanted to be bullied by Howard, even the teachers.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Does everyone have their weekly assignment?&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta asked his classroom of students who looked back at him blankly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t give us an assignment yet,&rdquo; Benjamin said with his hands supporting his head.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta said while looking at the dust on the back of his pants. &ldquo;You have to journal your dreams for the next week. No one appears to be able to dream anymore, especially here in New York. When you have a dream and you remember it in the morning, write it down in a journal. I&rsquo;ll ask a few of you to share your dreams with the rest of the class.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin was a little excited about this task because he loved dreaming. Or, to be more precise, he loved dreaming about adventures that he and dinosaurs would undertake. This would be the easiest assignment to complete, he thought to himself as he left the classroom at the end of the day. He could fill up his journal in one night.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The school buses were parked next to each other to take the children home. Since Benjamin lived on the other side of the city than the other students, this was a welcome time of the day. Benjamin hurried to bus number forty-two but as he moved forward, he felt a sudden tug at his shoes. Before he could realize what had happened, he felt as it he was flying. He wished he was flying because if he was flying, he would not be falling. Benjamin fell to the sidewalk and scraped his hand. He could hear Howard Horne laughing at him from behind. Howard had tripped Benjamin by attaching a string to two poles.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin gathered the books that had fallen from his backpack and hurried again to the school bus. The sooner he was in the bus, the sooner he would be away from Howard. But as he stood at the entrance to board, the bus driver took one look at Benjamin&rsquo;s scraped hand and shook her head.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You should get a bandage for that,&rdquo; she said while she chewed gum loudly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly, careful not to make eye contact with the bus driver. He knew that if he made eye contact, she would continue to ask questions.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;No, I think you should see the school nurse before you get on board,&rdquo; the driver continued as she closed the door in front of Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Howard Horned laughed loudly from another bus. He groaned for what he hoped to be the last time as he marched back into school to see the school nurse. He was fine. He knew that. Dr. Connolley told him he was healthy. A little scrape wouldn&rsquo;t cause him any harm, he thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>But, that was not exactly true. Benjamin was becoming more and more upset with how he was being treated at school. As the nurse bandaged his hand, he imagined what it would be like to be twelve inches taller than everyone else at the school. No one would push him. No one would tease him. He would be so intimidating.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;And, you&rsquo;re all set,&rdquo; the school nurse said gently.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As Benjamin stood up to leave, he watched the bus drive off without him. He let out one big sigh and then started walking home. It started to rain, of course, a few blocks from home so Benjamin ran the rest of the way. He entered the house and his mother looked shocked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you on the bus?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Long story,&rdquo; Benjamin muttered as he walked upstairs.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re eating dinner in a few minutes, Benjamin,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham called after him.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin went into his room and lay on his back on the bed, staring into the white ceiling above him. Tomorrow, he decided, would be better than today. It had to be.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin!&rdquo; he heard from downstairs.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He ran downstairs to find his father and mother already sitting at the dinner table, in the middle of which sat Benjamin&rsquo;s favorite food, spaghetti and meatballs. If each day was a game of positives and negatives, spaghetti and meatballs was a big positive.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We have an announcement to make, Ben,&rdquo; Mr. Buckingham said. Benjamin always imagined that he was a smaller version of his father and that at any moment, he would find himself to be about the exact same size with the exact same laugh.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;An announcement?&rdquo; Benjamin asked while plunging his fork into one of the meatballs.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Ben,&rdquo; his dad continued. &ldquo;Your mother and I wanted to let you know that you are going to be a big brother!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>His mother and father wore smiles larger than the room. Benjamin, however, dropped his fork with a meatball on it onto his plate. The family dog Jupiter, a golden retriever, barked at attention.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Ben? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; his dad asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a brother?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with concern.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes! Isn&rsquo;t that great?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, can you wait a little bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not going to be tomorrow. It&rsquo;ll be a few months.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;How about years?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh, no it won&rsquo;t be years.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to be a big brother? You&rsquo;re going to have someone who is going to look up to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Benjamin said while staring at the meatballs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What don&rsquo;t we understand?&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you have another boy, that means that there are going to be two Buckinghams being picked on at the school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin,&rdquo; his dad started. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make sure neither you nor your brother are being picked on at school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When do I get a brother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Around six months,&rdquo; his mom answered with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin took a big bite of a meatball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I have such a hard time, how will my brother survive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.iq2psjhm42mt"></a><span>Chapter 2: In Which There Is A Nightmare</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin tossed and turned in bed, unable to get himself into a deep sleep. He went through all of the typical things the he did to prepare himself for a night of dreaming about dinosaurs. He counted the number of figurines in his room. One hundred and forty-seven. He studied the skeletons of his favorite dinosaur, the tyrannosaurus rex. And, he even walked through his dreams from the previous five nights. But, nothing was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up from the bed and looked at it accusingly. There must be something wrong with it because it would not let him sleep. Benjamin gave the mattress a kick to the side as he would give his computer when it started to make a noise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his backpack, he retrieved that empty dream journal that Mr. Marchetta had given the class to record their dreams for the week. It was the same type of journal that he was given to record the foods he ate during a week, the birds he saw during a week, and the number of times Jupiter jumped into the ground floor family swimming pool from the second floor balcony. Six times. Benjamin was convinced that Mr. Marchetta had billions of these journals in his classroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paced back and forth in his bedroom. Still feeling alert, he turned on his computer and set the volume to a low level that he assumed would not wake his parents. He navigated the internet until he found </span><span class="c4">Jurassic Superheroes</span><span>&nbsp;episodes</span><span>, a popular television series in which a group of good dinosaurs destroy fat, tall Professor Undutois&rsquo; plans to destroy the world. His favorite episode also happened to be the episode that his mother felt was too violent and would not let Benjamin watch again. But since she was asleep and Benjamin wanted to go to sleep, he thought there would be no harm in watching the episode again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinosaurs were flying in an airplane together when they saw a newsflash that Professor Undutois was going to destroy a large metropolis by blasting it with a gigantic blue laser. One of the dinosaurs knew that it would take at least fifteen minutes until Professor Undutois could start his evil plan. They needed to land the plane immediately and find his location before it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched the dinosaurs ride their motorcycles between cars and trucks along a crowded highway, their eyes focused on an evil trailer in the distance. Suddenly, the backdoor of the trailer opened and Professor Undutois threw bowling balls at the dinosaurs. They dodged left and right and Benjamin&rsquo;s heart, which normally began racing during this scene, stayed very, very steady. He had watched the dinosaurs destroy Professor Undutois&rsquo; plans thousands of times and he knew their lines, strategies, and characters as well as he knew himself. As the dinosaurs steered closer to Professor Undutois, Benjamin&rsquo;s eyelids began to close and his brain took over the story in Benjamin&rsquo;s dream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinosaurs rode immediately next to Professor Undutois&rsquo; trailer causing the evil villain to brake suddenly and turn sharply off the highway and into the European streets below. Benjamin and the dinosaurs chased after him, Benjamin leading the way on a light green bicycle. He passed old coffee shops with women drinking espresso and dodged pedestrians carrying baguettes and swerved around taxis transporting people on these Parisian streets while keeping his eye on Professor Undutois in the distance. Benjamin knew exactly where his nemesis had stationed his laser; it was positioned at the top of the Eiffel Tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stopped chasing after Professor Undutois and instead started racing towards the large metal structure in the middle of Paris. The Eiffel Tower was only a quarter mile away as darkness suddenly overcame the city, sending Benjamin&rsquo;s heart into a fast pace. Professor Undutois was nearly at the destination and Benjamin thought, for a moment, that he would not be able to stop him from doing harm. As soon as he started to doubt himself, he realized that if he did not stop Professor Undutois, no one would. He took a deep breath and tried to find courage. As thunder and lightning overwhelmed Paris, Benjamin ran to the Eiffel Tower and began to ascend it to the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, Professor Undutois came down from Eiffel Tower and ran away as fast as he could, his arms flailing as he screamed loudly. Benjamin stood confused because his dreams never ended this way. Professor Undutois must have another scheme to destroy earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Benjamin looked to the top of the Eiffel Tower, he realized that was not the case. A gigantic figure stood at the top and bellowed so loudly that Benjamin could feel the growl pulse through his tiny body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, it&rsquo;s time to wake up,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham said as she opened Benjamin&rsquo;s door on her way downstairs to the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin woke up and stared at his computer. He felt that something was wrong with how he woke up. He pinched himself and rubbed his eyes over and over to make sure that he was indeed awake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all of his dreams he ever had, there was never an evil villain other than Professor Undutois. Benjamin didn&rsquo;t know what that other monster was it was not good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin!&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham yelled from the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin ran downstairs and pondered what had just happened over french toast. Mr. Buckingham was holding the newspaper with a headline </span><span class="c4">DREAMS HAVE DISAPPEARED</span><span>. He continued to think about the monster at school and wondered if there was something in one of the </span><span class="c4">Jurassic Superheroes</span><span>&nbsp;episodes that he was misremembering. He knew them completely, though, so it was quite unlikely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;On Tuesday, I dreamed that I was at dinner with my parents when my brother spilled lasagna. It was going to fall on our dog but I saved her just in time,&rdquo; one of Benjamin&rsquo;s classmates said in front of the class. Each of his classmates was reading from their dream journals and Benjamin was beginning to think that he might be teased if he read about his dreams fighting crimes with dinosaurs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Howard,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta read from a list on his desk. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re next. Please read your dreams to the class.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard walked to the front of the class with his journal, smirking at Benjamin along the way. He cleared his throat arrogantly and Benjamin rolled his eyes, wishing Howard would embarrass himself in front of everyone. Instead, Howard started to detail dreams that everyone in the class thought were exciting and thrilling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was a gladiator Wednesday night and there was a dragon that had invaded our school,&rdquo; Howard said as he clenched the journal with one hand and pointed to his classmates with the other. &ldquo;The dragon was here to destroy us. It was going to destroy all of us. It blew fire everywhere and the school started to burn. This wasn&rsquo;t so bad but I was not going to let the dragon destroy our houses. And, the baseball field. I ran after it and then I destroyed the dragon using my gladiator shield and gladiator sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class applauded and Benjamin participated, weakly, so that he did not draw attention to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, you&rsquo;re next,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin gulped. His dreams were not nearly as courageous and none of the characters in his dreams were people who he knew in real life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, come on,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta said because Benjamin had not yet moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the front of the class with his journal in his left hand and a worried state in his mind. And just like he did in his dreams when he was losing confidence, he took one big breath to try to get as much of it back as he could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The other day I dreamed that I was with a group of dinosaurs in Honolulu. The evil villain Professor Undutois was going to start a volcano that would destroy the entire island. I led the dinosaurs up the volcano and found Professor Undutois and his evil machine. I went up to him and said--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an episode!&rdquo; Howard Horne yelled from the back of the class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Howard, quiet,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta interjected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a dream!&rdquo; Howard said with a laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the tenth episode of </span><span class="c4">Jurassic Superheroes</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire class started to laugh as Benjamin&rsquo;s face turned red. It was an episode of that popular television series but it also happened to be his dream. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do next so he continued to stare into his journal in hope that time would move much faster than it was. He had lost any confidence that the deep breath had given him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, you can continue,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should,&rdquo; Benjamin said nervously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta said. &ldquo;But, that will mean you still have to complete your assignment. You can&rsquo;t disguise television episodes as your dreams. If you don&rsquo;t have a dream, just say that you didn&rsquo;t have a dream. Don&rsquo;t lie about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; Benjamin said quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I bet I&rsquo;ve already seen all of your dreams on television,&rdquo; Howard said over the laughter of all the other kids in the classroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dinner, Mr. Buckingham made waffles topped with fruit because it was his favorite meal and because he had decided that the family did not consume enough waffles. Benjamin did not have any complaints but he was distracted by the events of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We had to read through our dream journal at school today,&rdquo; Benjamin began, slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham responded as she set the table. &ldquo;How did it go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Mr. Buckingham said as he continued to make waffles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;None of my dreams are creative.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure they are. You told me all about those dinosaur dreams,&rdquo; his dad continued. &ldquo;And, frankly, I don&rsquo;t know how anyone would think that they weren&rsquo;t creative.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just that they are from</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Jurassic Superheroe</span><span>s.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not watching that episode I told you not to watch, are you?&rdquo; his mother asked as she handed him a napkin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, but all my dreams star me and I go around with the dinosaurs stopping Professor Undutois.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Those are great dreams!&rdquo; his dad continued while making more waffles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think we have enough waffles,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham whispered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ten more?&rdquo; he asked quickly. &ldquo;Did you know that I haven&rsquo;t had a dream in months. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the last dream I&rsquo;ve had. I&rsquo;d love to have a dream where I am parading around with dinosaurs solving crimes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, all the other kids in school have dreams that different. I want my dreams to be like their dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Different is good. You should be glad you&rsquo;re different. One day, you might regret that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about getting rid of my dinosaur posters in my room,&rdquo; Benjamin said to his parents shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Buckingham put down the waffle maker and Mrs. Buckingham stopped setting the table. They were surprised with Benjamin. He had not thought about it for very long but he had decided that by getting rid of the dinosaurs in his room, he would have different dreams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How about this,&rdquo; Mr. Buckingham continued slowly. &ldquo;You keep all the dinosaur stuff in your room for a month. If you don&rsquo;t have a creative dream in a month, we&rsquo;ll redesign your room to something else. Maybe sports? Cars?&rdquo; Mr. Buckingham paused and looked at Mrs. Buckingham briefly. &ldquo;Girls?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Buckingham rolled her eyes at Benjamin&rsquo;s dad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve had a bad day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But the great thing about having a bad day is that the next day is always better. Tomorrow will be better than today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who wants some waffles?&rdquo; Mr. Buckingham asked with four enormous plates of waffles and very little fruit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The television was playing in the family room and an emergency alert appeared at the bottom of a news television show: </span><span class="c4">WE CAN NO LONGER DREAM....</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.1pfpx0jjrb5g"></a><span>Chapter 3: In Which There Is A Dinosaur</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, Benjamin dreamt that he was meeting the dinosaurs at Prague Castle to discuss Professor Undutois&rsquo; plan to destroy the Czech Republic capital by flooding the city. Benjamin had to figure out where his evil nemesis was going to access enough water to execute the plan. Benjamin and the dinosaurs looked down from Prague Castle to the river below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There just isn&rsquo;t enough water there to flood the entire city, Benjamin thought to himself. There was no ocean or lake nearby. If Professor Undutois was going to bring in a vast amount of water, Benjamin would be able to see it from the castle. He rubbed his brow as the stegosaurus, tyrannosaurus rex, and brontosaurus waited to hear the plan. Benjamin was confused because he could not figure out where water could come from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he had his answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Professor Undutois is going to make it rain upon Prague until the city is underwater,&rdquo; he proclaimed to the seated dinosaurs. &ldquo;We have to find the machine he built to create rain and stop him before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What does the machine look like?&rdquo; the tyrannosaurus rex asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;But, it has to be large enough to produce big clouds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin noticed that the previously clear blue sky had one small cloud floating in it. He pointed at the cloud and then followed its direction so that he could imagine where it came from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he yelled as he traced the cloud&rsquo;s origins to the ground. &ldquo;The machine has to be over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the dinosaurs looked in the direction Benjamin was pointing and agreed that his conclusion made perfect sense. Before their eyes, they watched another cloud appear from the ground. Then, another. And, another. There was no doubt in Benjamin&rsquo;s mind that Professor Undutois was making rain clouds and that the evil nemesis would continue to do so until Prague was underwater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get him!&rdquo; Benjamin shouted to his friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raced down Prague Castle and through the old city, navigating the roads on bicycles so that they could dodge the trolleys quickly and safely. Benjamin&rsquo;s heart beat faster as he realized that this beautiful city could be lost if he didn&rsquo;t stop Professor Undutois. It was a lot of pressure, he thought, but he would do it with the assistance of his friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think we should go--&rdquo; Benjamin started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; the brontosaurus yelled back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How can you be hungry now? Can&rsquo;t you wait until after we arrest Professor Undutois?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m pretty hungry,&rdquo; the brontosaurus named Gary added. &ldquo;I think I need to eat or I&rsquo;m not going to be help at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is anyone else hungry like Gary?&rdquo; Benjamin asked his friends while standing in the middle of Wenceles Square.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I could use a nap,&rdquo; the tyrannosaurus rex named Snark said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A nap!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been going pretty fast for quite some time. I&rsquo;m kind of tired.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t have time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a long nap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How long will it be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Twenty minutes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Twenty minutes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If I start now, I think it could be fifteen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gary came back with a gigantic salad and began eating it on a park bench.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, Snark. Get some sleep,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Gerald and I will find a way to get to Professor Undutois faster so that we don&rsquo;t lose much time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, I kind of have to...,&rdquo; Gerald the stegosaurus paused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Use the restroom,&rdquo; Gerald whispered into Benjamin&rsquo;s ear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Benjamin said as he flung his hands to his side. &ldquo;Go use the bathroom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald stumbled away from the group, Snark slept on the ground, and Gary ate on the parkbench. Benjamin was sure that he was losing valuable time that should have been spent stopping his evil nemesis. He turned his head to the sky and noticed that there were more than ten clouds in the sky. It was only a matter of time before the sky was covered with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can wait much longer,&rdquo; Benjamin said to Gary. &ldquo;I need to go stop Professor Undutois.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only be a few more minutes,&rdquo; Gary said as he chewed on some carrots. &ldquo;But, I kind of have to use the bathroom as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go,&rdquo; Benjamin decided. &ldquo;When Snark wakes up and Gerald returns, find me where Professor Undutois is creating the clouds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sounds good, Ben,&rdquo; Gary replied while eating broccoli.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin did not like the idea of abandoning his friends but he also did not like the idea of Professor Undutois flooding Prague. He thought that he would find the villain and when the dinosaurs were ready, they would not have to waste any time searching. They could simply come to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky started to hold more clouds and then, Benjamin felt a raindrop. It was the first raindrop he had felt and so, he was not very nervous. Then, he felt another and then another. Professor Undutois was well underway with his plan and Benjamin needed to stop him quickly. If the rain continued at this pace, there could be a flood very soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin found an abandoned bicycle and rode it to the cloud machine. He saw the object on the top of a small apartment building. But, he could not see Professor Undutois.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very likely that Professor Undutois had gone to stop them from interfering with his cloud machine. Since Benjamin had left his friends behind, Professor Undutois would not realize that there was nothing to stop Benjamin from turning off the machine. Benjamin inhaled deeply and then began to climb the exterior staircase of the apartment building to the roof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clouds scattered themselves across the sky and the rain began to pour more violently. Benjamin climbed faster and faster, careful not to slip on the metal steps. When he reached the rooftop, he saw the machine and also saw that the buttons to control it were missing. Professor Undutois had them, he thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never stop me this time, Benjamin,&rdquo; Professor Undutois yelled from the rooftop across the street.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin thought quickly about what to do next because he did not believe he could turn off the machine without obtaining the controls that Professor Undutois held. As the rain started to pour more violently, he climbed back down the apartment building and raced across the street. He was about to ascend the staircase when he saw Professor Undutois descending the staircase, heading right for Benjamin. Benjamin took a step back and prepared himself to tackle the evil villain as soon as he was within reach. This would be Benjamin&rsquo;s most successful win yet.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Oddly, though, Professor Undutois was screaming. He was screaming so loudly that Benjamin realized the villain was not running toward Benjamin but away from something. Professor Undutois landed on the ground, threw the controls for the cloud machine at Benjamin, and then ran down the street with his arms above his head, panicking more and more.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin looked in the direction from which Professor Undutois came and saw the top of the staircase was beginning to shake. There was no time to lose, though, because Benjamin needed to stop the production of clouds. He looked at the controls that Professor Undutois had thrown at him and decided that it would be simple enough to stop the rain. Benjamin lowered his index finger onto the OFF button when bricks started to fall from the side of the apartment building. Benjamin looked to the roof and saw the most gigantic face of a monster he had ever seen.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>It was the same monster.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>It screamed at Benjamin more loudly than any noise Benjamin had ever heard previously.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>It displayed teeth that were like enormous swords.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>It emanated fire from its body as if it was a moving volcano.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>And, it moved slowly towards Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin did not know what to do in this situation because he had never encountered such a thing before. If he turned off the rain, he thought, the episode would be over and he will have won. His finger clicked the OFF button on the controls and the clouds stopped appearing and the rain stopped falling and Prague stopped being flooded. But, the monster kept moving toward Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>It jumped to the street level, destroying the cars and trucks that it landed upon. Benjamin realized that this monster was after him. And, Benjamin could not hide his fear. His legs shaked. His arms felt numb. His muscles felt immobile. His face felt weak.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And then, he felt a painful thud in the side of his body. He looked to the ground and realized that he was moving, but his legs were still and his body was still. Snark had grabbed him and ran faster than Benjamin had ever seen him run before. The monster began to chase and Snark sprinted more quickly away, sprinting down deserted streets and heading for a section of the city that Benjamin had not seen before.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin panicked and did not enjoy the dream anymore. He felt in danger and he felt that his friends, the dinosaurs, recognized that there was indeed a danger. Benjamin wanted to leave, so he did.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He woke up.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He rubbed his eyes and stretched his arms and remarked how his heart was racing a little bit more than he was comfortable with.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; he thought to himself, disappointed that he did have a successful dream and curious as to why that monster appeared again.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin threw his legs over the side of the bed and although he was still waking up, he realized that something was wrong. Whenever he looked to his wall, his eyes were inline with the poster of a stegosaurus. But now, his eyes were well above the poster. In fact, his head was only a foot away from the ceiling. Benjamin looked down and realized that he was almost six feet above the ground. And if he was six feet above the ground, there was something underneath his bed.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He jumped to the ground, looked under his bed and screamed. There was a dinosaur who did not look too unlike the dinosaur in Benjamin&rsquo;s dreams named Snark. The dinosaur looked at Benjamin and screamed in return.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin screamed.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Snark screamed.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin panicked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Snark panicked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin tried to run away.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Snark tried to run away.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin wanted to exit the room but Snark was standing in the path to the door. As Benjamin moved to one side, Snark moved to that same side in an awkward dance of two very scared creatures. And then, Snark grabbed Benjamin by his shoulders.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The only thought that passed through Benjamin mind was that he was going to be eaten at that moment. It was inevitable. Snark was probably hungry and Benjamin was food. But if I&rsquo;m going to be eaten, Benjamin thought, I&rsquo;m going to run away and hide. And since he couldn&rsquo;t move, he fought the only way he knew how to fight; he spat into Snark&rsquo;s eye.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh, gross!&rdquo; Snark replied as he dropped Benjamin and rubbed the left side of his face. &ldquo;Gross!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The voice sounded a lot less menacing than Benjamin had expected. It sounded like it belonged to a man older than Benjamin but not as old as his dad. It sounded as if it was from someone who was not a kid but not yet an adult. Benjamin stepped backward slowly to the door so that he could escape.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get in so much trouble for this!&rdquo; Snark said as he sat heavily upon Benjamin&rsquo;s chest of dinosaur toys, denting the middle quite significantly. Snark waved one of his claws against his face to brush away some dust in his eye. &ldquo;Come on, Rodney. Pull yourself together. You can do this.&rdquo; Snark took a deep, long breath. &ldquo;You can do this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Rodney?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with curiosity.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Snark turned quickly to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Listen, Benjamin,&rdquo; Snark said. &ldquo;You need to go about your day and when you come back to your room tonight, I&rsquo;ll be gone. Actually, it would be really, really great if you didn&rsquo;t tell anyone that I&rsquo;m here. Can you do that for me? I mean, I&rsquo;m really, really trying hard to keep this job and I&rsquo;m really, really close to losing it. I need you to do a big favor for me and not tell anyone that I was here. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll lose my job. Is that OK?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your job?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh, I keep talking and I get myself into more trouble,&rdquo; Snark continued as he shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that, Benjamin. I&rsquo;ve said too much. You just have to promise me that you&rsquo;re not going to tell anyone that I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of hard,&rdquo; Benjamin responded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve destroyed my room and you&rsquo;re making so much noise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Snark and Benjamin looked at the room which appeared to have been torn apart by a tornado, the posters and toys strewn everywhere. The bed was almost unusable and there was clothing everywhere. The lamps were knocked over and there were gigantic tyrannosaurus rex footprints everywhere, including the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin!&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham yelled up the stairs. &ldquo;Stop jumping around up there and come down for breakfast!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You need to clean this up,&rdquo; Benjamin said to Snark.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t clean it up,&rdquo; the dinosaur responded to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You made this mess! You clean it up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;But, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got these tiny arms. It&rsquo;ll take me weeks to clean up and I need to get back to work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Work? What do you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I told you I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re an accountant too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin, I&rsquo;m sorry I destroyed your room but I have to go and I need you not to tell anyone that I was here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Benjamin said with a little anger at the state of his space. &ldquo;But, you&rsquo;re going to have to go out through the window.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;The window!&rdquo; Snark yelled with surprise.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;If my mom sees a dinosaur was in my room, I&rsquo;m going to be in even bigger trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going out the window!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Why not? Is it the arms again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not how I can leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;How are you going to leave?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve destroyed my room and now you&rsquo;re going to run around my home. Do you know what the kids at school are going to say about me when they find out a dinosaur came from my room?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I know, I know. I&rsquo;m going to leave quickly but I can&rsquo;t let you know how I&rsquo;m going to leave. You just need to step into the hallway for one minute.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;If you steal any of my toys,&rdquo; Benjamin began.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to steal any of your toys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Or the posters!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to steal any of your posters!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Just, please, Benjamin, I&rsquo;m going to get into so much trouble. I&rsquo;m really late. I need to go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he gave one last frustrated look to Snark for the inconvenience of the morning. He stepped into the hallway and closed the door, but only until there was a tiny sliver through which he could see what Snark was going to do next.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin watched Snark walk back and forth with his claws on his head, obviously worried about the state of things. He kept looking at his wrist, upon which Benjamin realized was a watch. He had not noticed it earlier. Maybe Snark really was late for something, Benjamin thought. Curiosity was overwhelming him and he wanted to know where he was going next. Dinosaurs did not just walk around the neighborhood trying not to be seen.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Snark took one more glance at his watch and rubbed his claws together. He grabbed the side of the bed and stood it up on its side. Benjamin couldn&rsquo;t believe what he was watching. Snark was making more of a mess of his room even after promising that he wouldn&rsquo;t. It would take him months to restore the room, Benjamin thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And then, a bright light appeared on the floor that had been previously hidden by the bed. It became larger and larger and brighter and brighter. Snark shielded his eyes and Benjamin did the same. And without saying anything to Benjamin, Snark jumped into the light in the ground as if it was a swimming pool and disappeared.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin&rsquo;s mind was overwhelmed with thoughts. Where was Snark going? How long had there been this light under his bed? Where did it go? Who was going to clean up this mess? How mad will his mother be?</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He opened the door to his room and stepped to the light, peering as closely to it as he could without falling into it. He couldn&rsquo;t see anything beyond brightness. And then, the circular light started to get smaller and smaller.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>More thoughts entered Benjamin&rsquo;s mind as he realized that a door to something else was closing. He did not know what was on the other side of the door but he did know that there was a dinosaur who was late for something. And, that dinosaur knew Benjamin&rsquo;s name. He struggled with what he should do next.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin, time for school!&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham yelled to him.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;School!&rdquo; Benjamin echoed to himself.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>I don&rsquo;t want to go to school today, he thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And so, he jumped.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.wjhcwdsidr61"></a><span>Chapter 4: In Which There Is A Lost Child</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin kept opening and closing his eyelids because he could not believe a space could be a dark as this was. He had never been in a place where he felt so alone and so isolated. It made him very uncomfortable and paralyzed. He didn&rsquo;t know what was ahead of him, what was behind him, what was beside him, or what was above him. The only thing he knew was that he was somewhere he did not want to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he followed Snark, he didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing. But at a minimum, he assumed there would be light and that he would be able to navigate his way around some new space. Instead, Benjamin didn&rsquo;t want to move, in case one step to his left led him to a five thousand foot fall off a mountain with rocks and trees and other sharp things ready to knock into his little body along the way. He thought that if he took one step forward, he might step onto some old wooden platform that could give way to him falling six thousand feet into an ancient gold mining shaft. He thought that if he took one step backwards, he might step get his foot tangled into a rope that had been placed to catch large animals like dinosaurs and suddenly he would be pulled seven thousand feet into the air, dangling from some magnificent tree. He leaned a little bit the left and then decided that taking a step to the left would be just as bad. If he took a step to the left, as opposed to the right, he might step into the opening of a gigantic volcano eight thousand feet tall, his tiny body flailing and falling into the erupting lava below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he worried that if he jumped, the land on which he currently stood might suddenly disappear, leaving him with nothing but his thoughts. And although he didn&rsquo;t know it well at the time, his thoughts were what he had at that time. What he didn&rsquo;t have was control of his thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Benjamin did the safest thing he thought he could do given the circumstances before him: he sat down. He would wait, he decided, until this perpetual darkness disappeared and then he would go about his way. There was no sense in perishing into the abyss without first understanding where he was, he decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat on the ground, he wished that his mind would wander into the many glorious things that might await him when the darkness faded. But instead, he could only image negative things like falling, failing, and perishing. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something hit him. He felt something brush by his back so quickly that it didn&rsquo;t hurt or even phase him. Nonetheless, he knew that something was close to him so he twisted his body in place so that he was facing a different direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something hit him again. This time, he felt it across his left shoulder as if someone had waved her hand across him quickly. Benjamin cowered down lower to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something hit him twice, this time on both the left and right shoulder. Benjamin was still not going to move, because the dangerous elements had not changed, but now he became worried that although he could not see anything, something could see him. Perhaps, he thought, dinosaurs could see in the dark.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>More and more, Benjamin felt things hitting him but he did not know what to do.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>But then at a distance of about thirty feet away from where he was sitting, a tiny candle light was lit to reveal that there was no volcano, mountain, mine shaft, or dinosaur traps around him. There was flat ground and a light not too far away. As he was hit again, this time on the top of the head, Benjamin jumped to his feet and ran to the candle, hoping that he could use it to illuminate more of what was around him.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He examined the light and saw that it was on top of a wooden pole. Without thinking about who turned the light on, he grabbed the torch and slowly walked forward into the abyss.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He was glad that he had light because he could convince himself that he was just imagining things. But, he was not happy that he had light because he could see shadows everywhere. Shadows of various sizes were moving at high speeds all around him. As soon as he thought he found some empty ground, he saw more shadows.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He needed to move faster, he thought, because whatever was around him could see him, if they could not before. He jogged further and further, not knowing where he was going and not knowing what was happening.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Another light appeared to his left. As if someone was directing him to follow, Benjamin ran to that second light and noticed that it, too, was on a wooden stake. And again, he did not see anyone or anything around that could have turned it on. He saw only shadows.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin started to look for a candle when the environment around him changed so much that he no longer needed them. Light came from above and illuminated everything, allowing Benjamin to see clearly where he was.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He was standing at the entrance to a large stadium with tens of thousands of people cheering and screaming in the crowds. The audience was looking upon a circular ground covered with sandy dirt that felt hot under the blue sky and unforgiving sun. In the middle of this arena stood a gladiator, with a shield the size of his body and a sword twice as long. He pounded the sword into his shield and screamed back at the crowd. The crowd screams back at the gladiator.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Today!&rdquo; the gladiator beckons. &ldquo;We will no longer be afraid!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The audience of thousands jumped up and down as the gladiator gestures every direction, including a momentary glance directly at Benjamin. Benjamin did not know where he was but he did not want to be mistaken as something that gladiator was going to battle. So, Benjamin did what he thought he knew how to do best: he hid behind a doorway at the exit that would obscure his presence from anyone in the stadium.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The gladiator ran around the arena holding a gigantic flag three stories high of blue, yellow, and orange colors. The audience loved every moment of it and many people threw flowers upon the ground.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As the gladiator returned to the center of the arena, thunder broke out in the distance. The gladiator looked in the direction of the thunder and raised both his shield and sword into the air. The crowd erupted in excitement.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Thunder clapped again, closer to the arena. The gladiator yelled back and the audience erupted again.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Thunder clapped once more and Benjamin realized it was not thunder at all. It was a monstrous red dragon who breathed fire into the sky.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The gladiator ran through the crowd and grabbed the dragon by its tail, swinging it around and around and around until he threw it to the ground. He ran to its head and wrapped the dragon&rsquo;s jaw with thick rope, preventing it from doing any harm to the audience who loved every moment of it. Then, the gladiator sat on the dragon&rsquo;s back and grabbed its wings.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;This is our land!&rdquo; the gladiator yelled as he directed the dragon to fly where he wanted.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin&rsquo;s eyes were wide and his jaw was low. He did not know where he was but if there were dinosaurs, gladiators, and dragons, he decided that he made the correct decision to skip school that day.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As he leaned forward to try to get a better view of the gladiator flying the dragon around the arena, something brushed his shoulders again. But this time, they did not let go and Benjamin realized he was being pulled backwards by something he couldn&rsquo;t see.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.x0r5sb7xbx1v"></a><span>Chapter 5: In Which There Is A Castle</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Mr. Buckingham asked if Benjamin wanted to come to his office for Take Your Child To Work Day. Having to decide between going to school and not going to school was a rather easy decision for Benjamin who had never been to Mr. Buckingham&rsquo;s work. He was thrilled to go somewhere else and imagined it to be something of an exciting, thrilling field trip. Benjamin always wanted to know what it was like to be one of the adults.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the day wore on at the accountancy office, Benjamin was more bored than he had ever been in his entire life. This was not the exciting and thrilling day that he had imagined. Instead, it was a lot of accountants sitting in offices behind computers, talking to each other rarely. He could hear the air conditioner buzzing, the fax machine resetting, the printer spinning, and the workers typing. For most of the day, Benjamin sat on a chair thinking that school may have been more exciting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin reflected upon this memory as he sat on a boring office chair in a stale, white hallway, waiting to enter one of the offices. There was no one else in the hallway except for a man older than Benjamin&rsquo;s dad who sat on the opposite end, hundreds of feet away from Benjamin. The man was tapping his foot and it sounded like time passing slowly in an office building. At least it wasn&rsquo;t a noisy printer, Benjamin thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in so much trouble,&rdquo; the man said without looking at Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin didn&rsquo;t respond.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Excuse me! I&rsquo;m talking to you,&rdquo; the man repeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I just wanted to see where he was going. That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Benjamin replied back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, Benjamin, you should know that Pritchett doesn&rsquo;t like when people are late. You&rsquo;re probably going to be punished pretty heavily for what you did. But, you already know all of this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know any of this,&rdquo; Benjamin staggered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fox,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Russell Fox. And if I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t pretend you don&rsquo;t know anything. You know that only makes it worse for Pritchett.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. What did I just see?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In the arena, I saw a gladiator fighting a dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell Fox let out a shrill laugh that made Benjamin uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Russell Fox said. &ldquo;You should ask Pritchett that. You&rsquo;re the reason we&rsquo;ve got delays and problems, you know. It doesn&rsquo;t take much discipline to arrive and be on time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched Russell Fox play with his wristwatch, a watch strikingly similar to the watch that Snark had been wearing. In an instinctual reaction, Benjamin rubbed his wrist where a watch would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you wearing your watch?&rdquo; Russell Fox asked with a sinister look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wear watches,&rdquo; Benjamin said honestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re one of those,&rdquo; Russell Fox responded calmly as he opened up his jacket to reveal nearly a hundred watches lining the interior of his jacket. He inspected all of the moving faces and parts of all of the watches. Slowly, he removed one and tossed it down the hallway to Benjamin, who was not prepared to catch it. &ldquo;There, now you don&rsquo;t have an excuse any more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell Fox left and Benjamin looked at the watch that he was given. It was a golden watch that was well too large for his wrist. At about the center, it said </span><span class="c4">Ehtahl Time</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, come in,&rdquo; a female voice said from behind a wooden door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stood, put the watch in his pocket, and looked down the long, expansive hallway. There were no pictures and no windows but lots of fluorescent lights. He felt like he had gone to whatever was the opposite of dinosaurs and gladiators.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo; Benjamin asked an older woman with grey hair and red glasses perched on the end of her nose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I heard you tell it to Russell outside,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at her desk and noticed that there was a tissue box placed on top of a red painted square on the desk. There was a computer placed on top of a blue painted square, a telephone on top of an orange painted circle, a keyboard on top of a yellow painted rectangle, and so forth. Throughout the entire office, everything was placed on top of a painted shape that indicated where it would be. Nothing was misaligned and everything was organized to an unbelievably exact degree. When Benjamin looked to the floor, he noticed that the chairs also had markers on the wooden floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now, have a seat,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin sat down on the chair and felt that he was seated too far away from the desk to be comfortable. So, he nudged the chair forward a tiny bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock sighed, stood from her chair, pulled at her dress, and then walked behind Benjamin and pulled the chair back that same tiny bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What division were you supposed to be reporting to?&rdquo; Pritchett asked as she stared into her computer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Division?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. He leaned forward and nudged the chair a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett sighed, stood, walked behind Benjamin, and fixed the chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, division,&rdquo; Pritchett said as she looked back into the computer. &ldquo;Stop wasting my time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Division. D-I-V-I-S-I-O-N. Fine, what&rsquo;s your kpi code?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, you&rsquo;re going to make this much worse for yourself if you don&rsquo;t start cooperating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin shuffled in his chair and Pritchett stood up but before she could reset the chair, Benjamin looked to the ground and moved it for her. Pritchett nodded quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do this myself. What is your last name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Buckingham.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s eyelids covered half of her eyes as she stared deeply in her computer screen. Benjamin imagined that the computer was probably as organized as her desk was. Even the way Pritchett dressed was exact and precise. A vertical line in her top ended at the precise moment when a line in her dress began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I need your real name,&rdquo; she said with deep frustration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My name is Benjamin Buckingham.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, stop playing around with me. Give me your identification card.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Benjamin thought he would be able to identify himself because he happened to have his school identification card in his pocket. He pulled out the orange and blue card with a tiger mascot in the upper left hand corner. He stretched his arm forward and meant to place it on the desk, but he paused for a moment because there was no painted area where he should put it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just give me it,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said, annoyed for reasons that Benjamin did not understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also did not understand her reaction. Benjamin noticed that she was breathing much more deeply and that her nostrils had flared. She turned the card away from her face and looked at Benjamin, trying her best to maintain her composure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to wait here for one minute,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she hurries for the exit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin heard the sound of her heels hitting the hallway floor and realized that she was running. He thought for a moment about switching the tape dispenser with the cup holder on the desk, to see what her reaction would be. He thought that his mother would be thrilled if he kept his room as organized as Pritchett Pollock kept hers.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>A wind moved the white blinds that stretched from the ceiling to the floor and that hid the windows behind them. Benjamin stood from his chair and opened the door to the hallway as slowly as he could. After stretching his head to see that Pritchett Pollock was not within view, he moved quickly to the window and brushed the blinds away.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Before him, he saw a large village of stone buildings, scattered organically against a green mountain. Each building had a chimney and red clay roofing and stone paths to all of the other buildings. People were walking throughout the town, talking to each other, and reading newspapers. The entire scene felt like his neighborhood but the buildings being closer together meant that more people were interacting with each other. It felt warm and welcoming and natural in ways that Benjamin had not seen before. He did not know that such a place could exist.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>There were two other pieces of the village that Benjamin noticed were unusual. The first was a large tower in the center that stood hundreds of feet tall and seemed to have thousands of tiny moving parts. The second was that the entire village was surrounded by large granite walls. It was a castle, he realized. He was in a castle.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin!&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock yelled from behind Benjamin. The blinds swung back and forth as Benjamin released them quickly. Pritchett Pollock exhaled quickly as she watched her orderly environment become disordered. &ldquo;Please, follow me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Pritchett Pollock turned around quickly, clutching a clipboard tightly with her arms held close to her body. Benjamin did not hesitate and followed immediately behind her. Her walking pace was much faster than his and she made a much louder noise when her heels hit the ground than his sneakers did.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Benjamin asked quickly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Not now, Benjamin,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said in a more cordial tone than she had been using earlier.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I looked outside and I saw huge walls all around. Is this a castle?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, something like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Pritchett Pollock stopped abruptly. Benjamin almost walked right into her leg.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin, you need to be quiet while I escort you. You shouldn&rsquo;t be here. You know that and now, so do I. You&rsquo;re a real threat to our castle and to your own life,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said quickly while gathering herself. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to make sure you get back home. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be in school?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Benjamin said slowly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>They turned down one hallway to another hallway and then made a turn into another hallway. Each of these long, white tunnels felt stale, empty, and boring. It was exactly like his dad&rsquo;s accountancy office.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Pritchett Pollock stopped in front of one of the hundred identical doors that they had passed and spun around to face Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Enter this room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find a telephone. When it rings, answer it. Sweet dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin walked into the room and Pritchett Pollock closed the door behind him. In the plain, boring office was a wooden desk, a chair, and a black telephone. There wasn&rsquo;t even a window for him to further explore his neighboring environment. This room was, he decided, the worst room he had ever been in so far. He looked at the telephone and realized that his time of exploration was coming to an end. Surely, he thought, his mother would call at any moment and yell at him for not cleaning up his room. He would never know where the dinosaur went or what castle he was currently visiting. Instead, it would be right back to school and enduring more teasing from Howard Horne.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The telephone rang much more loudly than Benjamin expected, causing him to bounce from the seat.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Hi, mom,&rdquo; Benjamin said into the telephone.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m not your mom,&rdquo; said a deep masculine voice. Benjamin was glad the person on the other end could not see his face because it was as red as a tomato from the garden. &ldquo;Benjamin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, this is Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I need you to sit in the chair. Please tell once you are seated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin sat down again.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;m seated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin, it&rsquo;s very important that during the next thirty seconds, you do not move. You will notice that things are going to move around you but you cannot move. This is for your own safety. Do you understand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;OK, Benjamin. As soon as you hang up this phone, wait thirty seconds and then walk through the door.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long pause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Benjamin said into the phone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, I need you to hang up the phone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, right. Bye,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he place the receiver back on the telephone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he did, the ceiling moved up two feet and the walls began to separate in all directions. The floor shifted from side to side and Benjamin was moved to the other side of the room. The desk and telephone disappeared and a new floor appeared below him, much more colorful than before. The door that was the exit into the hallway slid into the floor and was replaced with a solid wall. The wall to Benjamin&rsquo;s right had been replaced completely and a golden door now occupied the center of that space. All of these pieces were finally aligned and Benjamin heard what sounded like air exiting pipes. The room had been completely rearranged and redesigned around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stood from the chair and admired the room for being much more interesting than the boring, white office environment he had previously occupied. Walking through the golden door should be easy enough, he decided. And surely, he thought, his mother would be waiting for him with a laundry bag and the vacuum cleaner. He was fearful at how upset she would be after having seen the destruction that a dinosaur can cause in a bedroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin took one step forward and the door got a little bit smaller but not so noticeable. He took another step forward and the door got much smaller. He kept walking directly to the door and as he approached it, the door was no larger than his foot. There was no way that he could exit through this door, he thought. It was impossible. He would have to be eight inches tall to exit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telephone had disappeared and he did not have any way of communicating that although he was below-average, he was large enough to fit through a normal door. Benjamin walked to the opposite wall where the exit to the hallway was and could not find any seams in the wall. He turned around, and upon doing so, saw that the golden door was full-size again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked toward the door and it continued to shrink in size.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then took a step backward and recognized what was happening. As he walked backwards, the door got larger. As he walked forward, the door got smaller.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Benjamin did what he thought any normal child would do. He turned around and walked backwards through the door.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.jvjvciak2b9t"></a><span>Chapter 6: In Which There Is A King</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stood in a grand hall that had portraits of men and women lining the walls with candles hanging from the ceiling on chandeliers and with tiny statues scattered across the floor. A deep blue carpet with bits or orange and yellow spanned the length of the space, below arches in the air. The grand hall made Benjamin feel like he was among something great, something much older than him, something that had earned respect and a place in history. It was much different than his classroom and neighborhood, Benjamin felt like he was among unearthly people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the far end of the room, standing upon a yellow star was a large man who looked like both a wizard and a professor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn yelled to Benjamin. &ldquo;No one in the castle is capable of walking. Where are you from? You&rsquo;re definitely not from this castle because you were able to walk backwards through our golden door. I&rsquo;m glad it worked, actually, because we&rsquo;ve had some major problems with that room in the past. The number of people we lost! Oh, the humanity! It&rsquo;s something, though, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You mean you can&rsquo;t walk backwards?&rdquo; Benjamin asked the heavy, old man with a curving chin. He wore a flowing blue velvet robe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. You&rsquo;ve got a flaw in your design.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have a flaw?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why sure! Do you have eyes in the back of your head?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to walk backwards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No one here can walk backwards?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone here walks forward, like people who do not have flaws do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And, where am I?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You, Benjamin, are in Ehtahl Castle and I am King Bernard Zwirn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt no more aware of his surroundings than he did when he arrived. The king stretched his arms wide and Benjamin realized that although this moment meant nothing to him, it meant a lot to the king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are the first visitor we&rsquo;ve ever had from the outside,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Outside?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes! No one from your hometown has ever been here. We take great pride in our secrecy and our secret location. It&rsquo;s a wonder you found us at all. But now that you&rsquo;re here, I&rsquo;d like to offer you a key to the castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn turned from Benjamin and ran down the hall like a rhinoceros running through a beautiful, pristine setting. The pictures shook, the candles bounced, and Benjamin thought for a moment that the king was not as graceful as he was portraying himself to be. Bernard Zwirn rummaged through dozens of suitcases at the end of the hall, throwing clothes and boxes and other ancient artifacts behind him as he desperately searched for the key.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in here somewhere!&rdquo; he yelled to Benjamin as he turned a large trunk upside down and sorted through its contents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin knew his mother would not be happy with the manner in which Bernard Zwirn was searching. The previously beautiful grand hall was becoming a messy large room. Bernard Zwirn walked to Benjamin like a defeated creature who returned empty handed following a long search.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he passed a small box to Benjamin. &ldquo;You have a key to my castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiny silver box with a gold ribbon looked as extraordinary as anything else around him. Benjamin unwrapped it quickly, tossing the paper to the ground, and opened the lid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grasshopper!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grasshopper. Look,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he offered the box back to Bernard Zwirn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn looked inside and there was indeed a grasshopper living in the box.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The grasshopper ate the key!&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn yelled accusingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a grasshopper can eat at key,&rdquo; Benjamin responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There was a key in here and now there is a grasshopper. That can only mean that the grasshopper ate the key,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he scolded the grasshopper. &ldquo;There can be no other explanation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Was the key smaller than the grasshopper?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It was a huge key. It was much larger than this grasshopper.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, there&rsquo;s no way the grasshopper can eat the key.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How do you know so much about grasshoppers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have a lot of them in my backyard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have grasshoppers in Ehtsetra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ehtsetra?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with a puzzled face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn looked at the grasshopper and then leaned in to Benjamin, his face contorted in confusion. He looked around the room quickly, as if he was unsure if anyone was watching him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, Pritchett told me you were a visitor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am a visitor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;From Ehtsetra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And if you are not from Ehtsetra, where may I ask are you from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he stepped away very slowly with incredibly long strides. Benjamin could sense that the grasshopper was nervous because it had stopped gnawing on the side of the box. Bernard Zwirn looked at Benjamin from the corner of his eye, continuing to move further and further away. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I have to--.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that, Bernard Zwirn sprinted away with his arms waving over his head, his feet slipping on the blue carpet. Benjamin never heard an adult scream as loudly as Bernard Zwirn did as he ran away. The faces in the paintings appeared to squirm with discomfort over the dreadful noise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin sighed. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time someone ran away after learning where he was from. No one seemed excited to see him but it wasn&rsquo;t for lack of acting politely. If he was not being nice, he would expect people to run away from him screaming. But given the circumstances, Benjamin did not understand what he was doing wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don&rsquo;t want to be friends with me, he thought to himself, I&rsquo;ll just explore on my own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were more paintings of people on the walls than Benjamin could count. There was Sir Laborious Maximus who looked like an Italian painter with an absurdly long mustache. There was Queen Jebra Coolihan whose head was four times larger than the rest of her body. There was a dog named Woolfred Woofery who looked more brave than all of the other people in the paintings. And then there was a tiny plaque for Aloysius Trenhaile but there was no painting. Instead, the words </span><span class="c4">We don&rsquo;t talk about it</span><span>&nbsp;were inscribed in the wall above his name. Benjamin found this intriguing but did not have further time to contemplate the difference in paintings because Bernard Zwirn reappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Bernard Zwirn came a security guard who was as short as he was wide. He looked like a cube with tiny little feet and short red hair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, get the monster!&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn yelled. Benjamin realized that Bernard was referring to him, that he was the monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel charged at Benjamin as if he was designed for this specific task. Benjamin did not move because he was not a monster and he also did not see Noel as a threat. The square man stood only three feet tall. But that did not deter Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s chants of encouragement. The king was convinced that Benjamin was a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am not a monster,&rdquo; Benjamin yelled back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something a monster would say!&rdquo; Noel said as he leaped into the air and dove headfirst at Benjamin. Benjamin took one step to his left and Noel hit the carpet like a dice being tossed across the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We do not welcome your kind here,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My kind?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, dream makers do not interact with nightmares!&rdquo; Noel screamed as he dove at Benjamin again, and again hit the ground like a square bowling ball would.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a monster or a nightmare!&rdquo; Benjamin responded. He was becoming more agitated that no one was believing him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what a nightmare would say,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said in response. &ldquo;Come on, Noel. Get him this time. Really concentrate hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He keeps moving,&rdquo; Noel said as he gasped for air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then wait until he stops moving,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said to Noel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But what if he moves again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, wait some more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can hear you,&rdquo; Benjamin said from the opposite side of the room with his hands on his hips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to us, monster,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin thought hard about how he could escape this situation. If he ran away, he did not know where he would run and Bernard Zwirn would further believe that he was a monster. He could not confess to being a monster because Noel would inevitably try to hurt him. He decided that the only way to remedy this predicament would be to convince these two men that he was not a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do monsters do?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Monsters cause nightmares. They terrorize people. You should know,&rdquo; Noel said. &ldquo;You are a monster!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, you&rsquo;re terrorizing me,&rdquo; Benjamin replied. &ldquo;So, you two must be the monsters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn stood tall and shifted his head slightly as he looked upon the young child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t the monsters,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t terrorizing you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are most definitely terrorizing me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are terrorizing us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was not! I was admiring these paintings and then that block monster tried to tackle me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That block&rsquo;s name is Noel Jaffin,&rdquo; Noel responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If monsters are creatures that terrorize other creatures, you are the monsters. I am not,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s expression change from cold and angry to warm and gentle. He began to breath more easily as he realized that he may have somehow convinced them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me, Benjamin,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said with his hands on his hips. &ldquo;Where is this New York you speak of?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.qr4uoxy0gq8v"></a><span>Chapter 7: In Which There Are Automatons</span></h1><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin followed Bernard Zwirn and Noel Jaffin to the end of the room to another golden door similar in design to the door that led him to this room in the first place. Instinctively, Benjamin turned his back to the door and started to walk towards it. As he made his way backwards, he paused as he saw Bernard Zwirn waving his hands in a flabbergasted state. Noel Jaffin touched his brow and shook his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I forgot you can&rsquo;t walk backwards. So, how do you walk through doors?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We walk through doors like normal human beings,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn answered as he turned the knob and stepped through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I can walk through doors backwards--&rdquo; Benjamin began before he was interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I initially thought you were from Ehtsetra but, alas, you are not. You are from New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he admired the green floor and yellow walls of a new hallway lined with windows on his left and plants on his right. He smelled flowers that reminded him of chocolates his parents would buy him in April. &ldquo;So, where is Ehtsetra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;People in Ehtsetra can walk backwards but we don&rsquo;t know exactly where they are located. And, we want it that way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, no. We really like people from Ehtsetra but it&rsquo;s for our mutual protection that we don&rsquo;t know where the other is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Protection?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as they walked through another door to a hallway with white ceilings and blue walls with fish tanks on his left and stained glass windows on his right. The tropical fish swimming throughout the enormous fish tank looked as if they were attempting to mirror the colorful glass display on their opposite side. &ldquo;I need you to answer some questions from my advisors so that we can figure out how we can get you home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin slowed his walking a little bit because he did not want to go home and the thought of doing so was almost paralyzing. He had just arrived and did not want to leave without knowing where the dinosaur went. There was more to see here than there was at school, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin?&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said when he realized that Benjamin was not moving forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three continued walking at a relaxed pace as Benjamin began to dread the possibility of returning so quickly back home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why did it say </span><span class="c4">we don&rsquo;t talk about it</span><span>&nbsp;above Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s an easy question,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn answered. &ldquo;Because we do not talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But who is Aloysius?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Does he live here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And people don&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Or he did something really bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to find someone who can talk about it so that I know why we don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn stopped walking and closed his eyes in a manner that Benjamin had seen his mother do when Benjamin had misbehaved. Noel Jaffin did not make eye contact with Bernard Zwirn and Benjamin sensed that the stocky man was uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, we do not talk about it!&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn snapped. &ldquo;You cannot talk about something we do not talk about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They proceeded to walk forward and Benjamin did not ask any more questions. And although he was even more curious about Aloysius Trenhaile, he did not want to be accused of being a monster again. Living with curiosity was better than not being liked, Benjamin decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As yet another door opened to yet another colorful room, Benjamin was blinded by a bright light that escaped so quickly. The circular room looked like the inside of a round monument, the walls made of marble and the ceiling holding a mural with clouds that appeared to move. It was not a large room and Benjamin felt that Noel Jaffin was occupying an unfair amount of it because of his size. And that may have been his only thoughts about the room had there not been one more unusual and unique feature; he was surrounded by twelve automatons, machines that looked like people seated at desks as if they were in a meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The elders of Castle Ehtahl would like to ask you a few questions, Benjamin,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he walked to a cabinet hanging on the wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are these machines?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin! There are our elders! Don&rsquo;t insult them in front of them. Wait until you leave if you want to insult them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, they aren&rsquo;t human.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not. They are automatons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The elders of your castle are automatons?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. The elders of my castle are lazy. They&rsquo;ve been replaced by automatons because they got bored of asking the same questions over and over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn placed a quarter into a slot in the cabinet and then pulled a gigantic lever from the cabinet to the floor. As he did so, sparks burst from each of the automatons and they all made rickety noises as their tin and copper pieces shifted back and forth. They did not look graceful or smooth because their movements were quite jerky and their exteriors looked rusty in several spots. Some of the automatons did not have complete control over their movements causing their arms, lips, or legs to move in a peculiar ballet of metal and electricity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; one of the automatons asked in a metallic, crisp voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin turned to face the automaton which had a pen in its crooked fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin Buckingham,&rdquo; Benjamin responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is your identification number?&rdquo; another automaton asked from a different direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Override! Outsider questions,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said quickly. He gave Benjamin a nod of approval because Benjamin obviously did not have an identification number. The automatons shifted back and forth and jerked their limbs in various movements that together looked like they had been synchronized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; another automaton asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where is Nu Work?&rdquo; another automaton asked with mispronunciation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In the United States?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK. We found New York,&rdquo; another automaton answered. &ldquo;Is your address 2788 Huckleberry Road?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Benjamin said with surprise. &ldquo;How did you--.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you nine years old?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Benjamin replied with even more surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is your relationship with Aloysius Trenhaile?&rdquo; another automaton asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who that is. Who is he?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; yet another automaton commented. &ldquo;Who is the President of the United States?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Barack Obama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And how did you get here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bernard Zwirn took me here,&rdquo; Benjamin responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pause!&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he raised the lever from the ground to the cabinet, powering down all of the automatons in the process. &ldquo;We want to know how you came to Ehtahl? How did you wind up in the castle in first place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait for the automatons to return,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he powered the automatons to the jingle and jangle and clanking of metal parts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin relayed the story of how he got to where he was today. He mentioned running through Prague in his dream, waking up to find a dinosaur under his bed, following the dinosaur into an unknown land, seeing a gladiator battle, sitting in an office building, and everything that led to that moment. If machines could look as surprised as Bernard Zwirn and Noel Jaffin did, these automatons were as shocked by this outcome as anyone else. Benjamin took a deep breath after he finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you really here?&rdquo; an automaton asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to see where the dinosaur was going,&rdquo; Benjamin said quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dinosaur?&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. The tyrannosaurus rex from my dream.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn groaned through his teeth and rolled his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Rodney.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rodney! He kept saying that name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Rodney Cohen,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said while shaking his head. &ldquo;That guy gets us in so much trouble we&rsquo;re not going to be able to do what we do much longer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it as we leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Leave?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Benjamin, we need to get you home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really your choice,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said. &ldquo;Elders, when does the next train leave?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The automatons moved back and forth in a more rigid, uncontrolled fashion. They jerked from side to side and steam started pouring from their heads, sending a screeching sound into the air. Joints started to disconnect and pieces of robots starts to fall all over the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One automaton leaned forward and moved its jaw slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ten minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ten minutes!&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn exclaimed. &ldquo;Benjamin, we have to go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But where am I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a tour on the way. We have to run!&rdquo;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.fd2tzvdchmqj"></a><span>Chapter 8: In Which There Is A Train</span></h1><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin and Bernard Zwirn sprinted down one hallway, then another, and another until Benjamin lost a sense of which direction he was going. Everything felt disorienting and confusing. The more he saw of this castle, the less he understand it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got nine minutes to get you to the train station,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said in between breaths.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I take the next train?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The trains are too infrequent and I&rsquo;ve got a busy schedule. If you don&rsquo;t get on that train, I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to do with you here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I could keep to myself. I&rsquo;ll just look around and see where all the dinosaurs live.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, you won&rsquo;t be able to live here because this place is much different than where you&rsquo;re from. This is, how should I say, a little bit like a manufacturing city.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A manufacturing city?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, we make something here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like bikes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he opened a door to the outside world. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated than that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you make?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, my,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he glanced at his watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be late. We&rsquo;ve got seven minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin thought about stopping, so that Bernard Zwirn had no choice but to let him hang out in Castle Ehtahl. Or, Benjamin thought Bernard Zwirn would have to carry him to the train station. And since the king brought in Noel Jaffin to handle the task earlier, Benjamin was sure that Bernard Zwirn would not exert any physical strength to get him on the train. He was a large man but he looked like he had the strength of someone a quarter the size. The same, Benjamin felt, went for his organizational skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sprint to the train,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a lot faster than you but in exchange, you have to tell me what you make here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Deal!&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said quickly, his brow covered in sweat and his chest heaving back and forth like rough waves in the ocean. &ldquo;We make dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You make dreams?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, we make dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn removed a necklace and held it to Benjamin. On the end, there was a small brass key that looked like it was much older than the king who wore it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to use this key to get into the train station. You go straight towards that gigantic tower, then make a left and run along the river to a series of blue, yellow, and green buildings. The yellow building is the entrance to the train station and you&rsquo;ll need this key to get inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean--&rdquo; Benjamin began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have five minutes to run straight for that gigantic tower, then make a left and run along--&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn began repeating the directions again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, sorry,&rdquo; Benjamin replied. &ldquo;What do you mean you make dreams?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We make dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You make dreams come true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t New York, Benjamin. We make dreams. When you go to sleep at night and you have a dream, those dreams are manufactured here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, here. And if you stay here, your presence might throw off the balance of peace and we&rsquo;re not going to be able to produce dreams for very much longer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he grabbed Benjamin by the shoulders. &ldquo;You have to leave because if you don&rsquo;t, this castle and the dreams it creates might be destroyed by nightmares. You have to run. The less you know, the better. If you want to have dreams of dinosaurs again, you need to sprint as fast as you can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin wanted to dream of dinosaurs again and immediately turned from Bernard Zwirn and ran as fast as he could. Run for the gigantic tower, Benjamin thought to himself. It was impossible to miss the tower and Benjamin had already seen it from the office building. As he got closer and closer to it, he noticed it had far more moving parts than he had thought. Each individual part seemed to move independent of all of the other parts, as if it was the most complex watch ever created. He wanted to inspect the tower further but he also wanted to have more dreams so he ran through crowds to the bank of the river. As he turned left towards the yellow building, he slipped on the ground and the brass key fell from his grasp. Benjamin got to his knees and crawled five feet to it. He reached for the brass key and extended his fingers. But then, a heavy leather boot with rusty metal lining stepped on it. Benjamin tried to push the boot away but it would not budge. He looked up and he saw a face he had seen previously. It was Richard Fox.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello again, Benjamin,&rdquo; Richard Fox said with a sly tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing on my key,&rdquo; Benjamin exclaimed. &ldquo;I have to get to the train station.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why do you have to go so soon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;King Bernard Zwirn said I have to or else I&rsquo;ll throw off the balance of dreams and nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Fox shifted more of his weight onto the brass key.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always saying that, you know?&rdquo; Richard Fox said with a curious grin. He wore a heavy leather trench coat and a dark hat that seemed too hot for such a warm day. Benjamin tried to push his boot again but Richard Fox resisted further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to let me go!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled at him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to stay?&rdquo; Richard Fox asked with an uncomfortably villainous tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, stay!&rdquo; Richard Fox yelled. &ldquo;I give you my permission.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, King Bernard Zwirn said--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, King Bernard Zwirn is always saying these things. He wants the castle all to himself and he doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to interfere. I bet he didn&rsquo;t show you any of the castle, did he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, no, he didn&rsquo;t. But, he seemed friendly enough and he told me that I needed to get home quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course he did. He wanted to get you out of the way so that he can make sure he can continue to manufacture dreams here. He doesn&rsquo;t want you to learn how they&rsquo;re made because that&rsquo;ll mean he won&rsquo;t be able to make them. I think you should stay, Benjamin,&rdquo; Richard Fox said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to leave!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right but I don&rsquo;t want to take any chances. I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin pushed one more time on Richard Fox&rsquo;s foot and the boot jerked away. The brass key looked delicate despite the heavy boot upon it. Benjamin grabbed the key and jumped to his feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow house, Benjamin thought to himself. He had to get to the yellow house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran past the blue building and then past the green building. At the yellow house, there was a keyhole in the middle of a large door that appeared to be the size of the brass key that Benjamin held. Benjamin jammed the key inside and was thrilled when he noticed it fit perfectly. He used the full weight of his tiny body to move the door open. Once there was enough room for him to squeeze inside, he found himself in the most beautiful, spacious, and grand train stations he had ever seen. There were people drinking coffee from balcony seats looking down on train conductors walking along the platform amid women selling flowers and men shining shoes. There was room for dozens of trains to pull into the station and the roof was high enough that it felt like it was an enclosed stadium. The outside of the yellow building did not foretell at all what Benjamin saw in the inside. He felt as if he had wandered into a time when trains were the most important technology of an era. And among these trains, Benjamin saw one train at the last gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt it was inappropriate to be sprinting as quickly as he was through such a tranquil, beautiful setting but he also felt there was no other option to reaching the train in time. He was ten gates away when he heard the conductor start the steam engine, nine gates away when he heard the wheels begin to churn, eight gates away when the cars started to tug at each other, seven gates away when he heard the train whistle, six gates away when the wheels made their first rotation, five gates away when the locomotive began leaving the station, four gates away when the first passenger car left the station, three gates away when half the train had left the station, two gates away when the locomotive whistled again, and one gate away when he watched it leave the station altogether.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He missed the train.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know what it meant to miss the train. There wasn&rsquo;t another train in the station but, presumably, he could just get on the next one and be home in time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Benjamin heard a man scream from the entrance of the train station. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; yelled Bernard Zwirn. &ldquo;You were supposed to be on that train!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I tried,&rdquo; Benjamin said between large breaths. &ldquo;I ran as fast as I could but it left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You should have run faster,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said with an increasing amount of anxiety. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good, Benjamin. This isn&rsquo;t good at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get on the next train,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one this afternoon, I&rsquo;ll take that one. If there&rsquo;s one this evening, I&rsquo;ll take it. Or even if I have to wait until tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll take that one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, the next train is in a month!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin&rsquo;s face turned white as he imagined what his mother was going to say to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A month?&rdquo; Benjamin asked quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, a month! You have to wait a month!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait a month!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know! You can&rsquo;t wait a month! That&rsquo;s why you need to be on that train,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn yelled to no one in particular.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t there more trains?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t leave Castle Ehtahl very often,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he sat on a bench next to a dozen dogs barking at a bird sitting on a standing clock. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get visitors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I tried really hard to get to the train station on time,&rdquo; Benjamin started to say, becoming a little scared and sad about the situation that he now found himself in. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try to miss the train.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It happens,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was going to make it but then Russell Fox stepped on the brass ring and I couldn&rsquo;t get it quick enough and then he delayed me by at least two minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn stood from the bench and looked even more concerned than he had been previously. The dogs next to him ran away and the bird on the clock took flight. The entire station went quiet and still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn asked very slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Russell Fox stepped on the brass key,&rdquo; Benjamin responded very quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How do you know Russell Fox?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I saw him in the hallway when I was waiting to talk to Pritchett.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And he prevented you from getting to the train station in time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He stood on the key.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did he say anything else to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin thought hard about this question and was worried that he was taking too long to respond. Everything Richard Fox had told him had been about Bernard Zwirn, and Benjamin was not sure if any of it was true. He did not know where he was and did not want to put himself in a situation where he felt in danger. He needed to quickly assess who could be his friends and protectors until he could get on the next train.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He said you wanted me to leave,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. I do want you to leave, for your own protection,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn responded. &ldquo;Did he say anything else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to these complicated questions did not come quick enough for Benjamin. He knew that Bernard Zwirn knew that Benjamin was stalling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He said you did not want anyone else to make dreams,&rdquo; Benjamin said each word while trying to observe Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Russell Fox!&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn yelled into the air. &ldquo;Benjamin, for the next month, you are not to talk to that man. You have to understand me. This is for your own protection. Russell Fox is not a good person these days. He was good, at one time, but those days are gone. This is a difficult time for Castle Ehtahl and I don&rsquo;t want you to get wrapped in the middle of it. I need you to obey my orders and I&rsquo;ll get you safely out of this castle in a month.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin swallowed hard and with his instincts felt that he had to trust Bernard Zwirn more than he trusted Russell Fox. Bernard Zwirn wanted Benjamin to leave and there was no harm in leaving. But, Russell Fox wanted Benjamin to stay and Benjamin did not know if there was harm in staying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pritchett told me you came here because you didn&rsquo;t want to go to school,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as they strolled for the exit of the train station. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re going to have to attend school here.&rdquo;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.9g7uhr7bgeo8"></a><span>Chapter 9: In Which There Is A School</span></h1><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin tossed and turned in his bed, hoping that a gigantic wave would send him flailing into a gigantic mast, that dinosaurs were on an adventure with him to stop Professor Undutois, and that he could be among his friends. But as he continued to roll about, he could not dream. He thought, perhaps, it was because he was in a different environment. This was not his bedroom, after all. It was a large room filled with ten other students who all lived in the same dormitory and attended the same class. Benjamin sat on the edge of his bed and remarked how everyone else was able to sleep peacefully. They must be having amazing dreams of far off places and incredible experiences and gladiator battles and being heros. All he got from his first night sleeping in this foreign place was exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights flickered on and the door at the end of the room opened, revealing a tall, skinny woman who looked much more refreshed than Benjamin felt. Benjamin presumed that this was his teacher, Estelle Lindenmeyer, because she looked very similar to how Bernard Zwirn had described her. She had light red hair and blue eyes slightly hidden by yellow glasses. Her hair lay on her shoulders and she always wore light color clothing like whites and off-whites and off-off-whites. And as she spoke, Benjamin understood why Bernard Zwirn referred to her as the nicest person in Castle Ehtahl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, time to wake up,&rdquo; Estelle Lindenmeyer said to all of the boys in the room. She then left, closing the door halfway, and walked to the other end of the hallway. Benjamin could hear the soft pattering of her shoes hitting the wooden floor as she took each step.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, time to wake up,&rdquo; he heard Estelle Lindenmeyer say faintly, most likely to the room that the girls occupied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was already awake because he barely slept. It was uncomfortable being in a new place with new people and he did not like that he did not have the privacy of his own bedroom. When he thought about the adventures that he was about to embark upon, he did not imagine that in some cases, the circumstances would be less inviting than his circumstances at home. He had his own bedroom at home, after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys stood, yawned, rubbed their eyes, and did the various other body movements that these creatures do in the first minutes of the beginning of a new day. Everyone looked similar to his class at home. People must not be that different, Benjamin thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Move,&rdquo; the boy on the bed next to Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Benjamin,&rdquo; Benjamin replied, trying to make his first friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on my shirt. Move,&rdquo; the boy said as Benjamin realized that he was standing on a shirt that the boy wanted to wear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, sorry,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he moved his foot. He had obviously made it dirty and was not thrilled about having unsuccessfully made a new friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the boy asked as he rubbed his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Benjamin. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; the boy answered as he stood and walked to the exit. &ldquo;But, I&rsquo;ve never seen you before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m new. I was supposed to leave on a train yesterday but I missed it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re in our class now?&rdquo; Ralph asked with a confused face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I guess so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Weird. Where are you from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Boys! Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Estelle Lindenmeyer said as she entered the door again. Benjamin was glad that she interrupted their brief, not very cordial conversation because he was not sure how to answer the question without causing alarm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the boys walked passed Estelle Lindenmeyer and as they did so, the teacher checked off their name with a pencil on a paper attached to a clipboard. The boys walked through and Estelle Lindenmeyer acknowledged their presence. But then, she saw that Benjamin was still in the room and that he was having a little trouble tying his shoes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad, once you do it a thousand times,&rdquo; Estelle Lindenmeyer said as she walked towards him. &ldquo;You must be Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Benjamin,&rdquo; Benjamin said awkwardly. He was still trying his best to make a good first impression with everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;King Bernard Zwirn told me all about you. My name is Miss Lindenmeyer and I&rsquo;ll be your teacher, for the next month I presume,&rdquo; she said so softly and warmly that Benjamin immediately knew that if no one else, he could trust her the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to miss the train,&rdquo; Benjamin offered as he did not want to be seen as irresponsible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she said as she escorted Benjamin through the exit. &ldquo;Our train schedule is goofy anyways. So, King Bernard Zwirn tells me that you&rsquo;re in the fifth grade. Is that correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m in fifth grade. My teacher is Mr. Marchetta but he isn&rsquo;t very good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no?&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said with more curiosity than Benjamin expected. &ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you like about the way he teaches?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t really pay attention to what the kids do in the classroom. I don&rsquo;t think he can see, to be honest. He looks like he&rsquo;s staring far off into the distance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, every teacher has a different teaching style,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she positioned Benjamin at the end of a line of about twenty students his age. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re going to find that my teaching style is a little different than other teachers you may have. For one, we spend a lot of time teaching and thinking about dreams because this is where dreams are made. You&rsquo;ll be fine and if you have any questions or if you get nervous about anything, let me know and I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt more relieved that his teacher was so much nicer than Mr. Marchetta. Miss Lindenmeyer already knew Benjamin&rsquo;s name and made him feel so calm that he began to think he might actually enjoy going to school here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students walked forward in a single line and Benjamin saw that they were all dressed in the same uniform. The boys had similar haircuts and the girls wore their hair in a similar style. The line itself alternated boy and girl, which Benjamin found amusing because his school was not as organized as this school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he walked forward, the girl in front of him turned and gave Benjamin a confused face. He expected to receive these types of expressions on the first day. These children already knew each other and Benjamin would be the new person. It was fine, Benjamin thought, because he was used to feeling like the odd person left out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continued walking forward and the girl spun around again, this time giving Benjamin a confused expression that bordered on anger. Benjamin did not know how to respond so he smiled cautiously. It was not his best smile. It may have been his worst, though. He was not sure but he was trying to smile somewhere in between his best and his worst smile. Never before in his life had he concentrated on such things before. He was determined to be liked and to be average.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl spun around once more and stared at Benjamin, then shook her head from side to side. Benjamin smiled again, this time showing more teeth than he wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Benjamin said quietly so as not to cause the entire line of students to turn around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the girl asked precisely. Her diction was perfect but her manners were abrupt. Benjamin worried that he was interacting with the bully in the classroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Benjamin. I&rsquo;m new.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re new. If you weren&rsquo;t new, I wouldn&rsquo;t have asked you who you were.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t say things like that so you must not be from here. Where are you from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the word New York left his mouth, all of the students stopped walking. There was a collective, loud gasp of surprise followed by books and backpacks falling to the ground. Several students hid behind other students while the larger of the bunch tried to move the line further and further away from Benjamin. He could feel their nervous, tense reaction as he watched them stare at him with wide eyes and lowered jaws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, children,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she walked to the back of the line. &ldquo;I guess now is as good a time as any to introduce our new student. This is Benjamin Buckingham from New York. He&rsquo;s going to be with us for the next month as a foreign exchange student. Everyone, please be nice and give a warm hello to Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, Benjamin,&rdquo; the class said in unison and in a worried, confused voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from New York,&rdquo; Ralph whispered to Miss Lindenmeyer loud enough that Benjamin could hear this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, right, so Benjamin isn&rsquo;t from Castle Ehtahl. Benjamin&rsquo;s from New York,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class reacted exactly as they had when they heard Benjamin say the word. There was gasps, books dropping, children cowering, and lots of fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And, that&rsquo;s OK. We&rsquo;re going to treat him like he&rsquo;s from Castle Ehtahl. He&rsquo;ll get along fine here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, we can&rsquo;t. He can&rsquo;t know what we learn here,&rdquo; the girl in front of Benjamin said with total concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, it&rsquo;ll be OK. He&rsquo;ll learn enough to make dreaming more interesting but he won&rsquo;t learn too much that he won&rsquo;t enjoy dreaming any longer. A month will be too short a time for anything crazy to happen. Now, let&rsquo;s keep going to the classroom,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she gently guided each student back into a single line.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin felt some nervous looks and glances from the other students. He did not think it was going to be easy to become friends with everyone now. No one seemed to like New York, he thought, and he didn&rsquo;t quite understand why.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>When Benjamin entered the classroom, he knew that he had entered a school in which he had never been before. There was color everywhere. Paper trees lined the back wall with branches that spread to the ceiling to reveal a blue sky with clouds hanging over desks. Flowers and animals lined the other sides, drawn to a detail that Benjamin thought looked so realistic. Each chair was a different color and each desk had multiple color combinations. It was like he had walked upon a painter&rsquo;s color pallet.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin sat in the back of the classroom, behind Selma Applebaum who had only moments earlier revealed that Benjamin was not from here. He did not like sitting near the class bully but he was content that at least, he was sitting behind her. As Benjamin thought about this some more, he was a little disappointed that he had already discovered which student was the bully. He was hoping that he could enter a classroom where there was no bully.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Today, we&rsquo;re going to continue our lesson on creating dreams for grumpy old men!&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer told the class as she drew two old men on the chalkboard. There were some giggles throughout the classroom. &ldquo;Per our lesson last week, who wants to tell me the three important rules that you have to keep in mind when you create a dream for a grumpy old man?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Every student stretched their hand to the sky but Benjamin noticed that Selma was stretching her hand much higher than all of the other students. She was almost standing as she stretched her body further and further. He had never been in a classroom where there had been such eagerness to answer a question.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Steven, why don&rsquo;t you give me the rules,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said to a larger boy who was sitting next to Ralph Eden, the boy whose bed was next to Benjamin&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Steven stood from his chair and counted the rules on his finger.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;First, the dream can&rsquo;t be too crazy because the grumpy old man could have a heart attack and that&rsquo;s not good,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she wrote</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;crazy dream equals heart attack</span><span>&nbsp;on the board.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Second, the dream can&rsquo;t be too happy because the grumpy old man will become even more grumpy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she wrote </span><span class="c4">too happy equals more grumpy</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;And third, the dream can&rsquo;t happen in too many different places or the grumpy old man will get lost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;The first two were correct,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;But, I think you&rsquo;re confusing the third one with one of the rules for creating a dream for women who get turned around easily. Do you know the third rule for grumpy old man dreams?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Eric stood and shrugged his shoulders. And as soon as his shoulders started to rotate around, Selma&rsquo;s hand shot back into the air again. She wanted to answer the question more than any other student in the room and Benjamin realized that Miss Lindenmeyer was deliberately not calling on her. But since no one else had a hand in the error, there was no one else to answer the question but Selma.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;OK, Selma,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said in a way that sounded like she said these words several times every day. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t include anything in the dream that made the grumpy old man grumpy in the first place,&rdquo; Selma said as fast as she raised her hand.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she wrote </span><span class="c4">grumpy memories equals grumpier old man</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin was impressed that Selma knew the answer but he did not understand what it meant. Who were these grumpy men, he wondered, and why were these kids talking about the rules for dreams. In his classroom at home, they only talked about their own dreams. It was confusing but he did not want to ask basic questions in front of everyone because he knew he was the only one who didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin, are you able to follow along?&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer asked as if she was reading his mind.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; Benjamin said quietly. &ldquo;But, how do you make dreams?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The class laughed and Benjamin immediately regretted asking the question.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a perfectly fine question, Benjamin. The class is laughing because they never thought to ask such a question. They&rsquo;ve been watching dreams be made their entire lives. Basically, we make dreams inside studios throughout the castle. Each person who has a dream, like the grumpy old man, has different rules assigned to them. So, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that we learn them here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Miss Lindenmeyer turned to the chalkboard and began to clear the chalkboard. Benjamin wasn&rsquo;t completely sure what she meant because it felt so foreign to him. People didn&rsquo;t make dreams. Dreams were something that happened in his head while he was asleep.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Did you understand that?&rdquo; Selma asked Benjamin in a way that suggested she wanted to give Benjamin more explanation.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Benjamin said with a confused tone. &ldquo;But, not really.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;Because I study the hardest in this classroom and I work harder than everyone else and I&rsquo;m not about to let someone from New York come in and ruin it all for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin was taken aback by her attitude and did not quite know how to respond. He did not want to agitate her further.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to ruin anything. I missed my train.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I bet you did,&rdquo; Selma said as she spun around and raised her hand to answer Miss Lindenmeyer&rsquo;s next question.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As Selma walked to the front of the classroom to draw a layout for a dream in which a grandmother parachutes over a length of the Amazon jungle, Benjamin thought about switching seats to be closer to Ralph and Steven. There was an empty seat near them and Benjamin had decided that it was in his best interest to be friends with them rather than Selma.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;And then you have to make sure a fire extinguisher is available for each of the actors because there&rsquo;s a chance that the grandmother could catch on fire,&rdquo; Selma concluded.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as the rest of the class groaned slightly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Selma knows all about fires because her dad broke the dream machine,&rdquo; Steven said as he gave Ralph a high-five.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Selma stared at Steven and Ralph as she slowly made her way back to her seat. Benjamin found it peculiar that in this classroom, some students would make such a comment to the class bully. He could never imagine a situation when he or anyone else would make a comment like that to Howard Horne.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Not nice, Steven,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;And remember, your mother has made her fair share of fires as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The rest of the class laughs in a way that Benjamin doesn&rsquo;t quite understand. He was also a little distracted because as bright as the room was, it was starting to get darker and darker. Over the course of a few minutes, the room became so dark that Miss Lindenmeyer had to turn on a light switch near the door. But, it was still early in the afternoon. The sun was still out, Benjamin observed through the window. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>His curiosity overwhelmed him and he raised his hand to find an answer.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Why did it suddenly get dark?&rdquo; Benjamin asked as he looked outside.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Before Miss Lindenmeyer could answer, there was a loud scream from outside the school. It was loud enough to cause Benjamin to worry that someone was in trouble. But inside the classroom, no one said anything and no one looked out the window. Everyone continued to stay seated as they had before.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said with her lips clenched together.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.4oalrdqmkoq"></a><span>Chapter 10: In Which There Is A Bully</span></h1><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin lay awake in bed staring into the darkness above him, wondering how worried his parents were that he was not at home. He also wondered if Mr. Marchetta even knew that he was gone. Being away from his family was causing him to miss them more; but being away from his school had quite the opposite effect. In fact, if it was not for his family, he could see himself living somewhere else indefinitely. Castle Ehtahl, on the one hand, may not have been the best choice as his first destination. For if nothing else, he was not able to sleep well there at all.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Pssst,&rdquo; a voice in the bunk next to him sounded. &ldquo;You awake?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The voice was none other than Ralph Eden, who Benjamin had become accustomed to knowing as the other boy in the dormitory who did not sleep at night. Ralph frequently used his flashlight to read books that were prohibited on school grounds. The only books the students were allowed to read during their personal time were books that had been written with incredible creativity and imagination. Books that downplayed excitement and fun were prohibited. They were the equivalent of poisoning the brain. They belonged to the nightmares.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Benjamin said without moving. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m usually awake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sleep?&rdquo; Ralph asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to sleep here,&rdquo; Benjamin replied. As the words left his mouth, he realized this was true. When he was home, he could easily prepare himself to sleep by imagining his favorite dreams. But here, he was forgetting them and was unable to prepare himself to sleep. He couldn&rsquo;t save the world from Professor Undutois.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It takes awhile to get used to not being able to dream,&rdquo; Ralph said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Not being able to dream?&rdquo; Benjamin rolled to his side and stared into further darkness. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t dream?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I could months ago but I haven&rsquo;t had a dream since then. My dreams were amazing. I was conquering land after land and building bigger and bigger castles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What happened? What did you stop dreaming?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t choose to stop dreaming. When our dream machine broke and we learned we only had a limited supply of dreams left, everyone in the castle had to give up their dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You gave up dreaming?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yep. And, that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t dream either,&rdquo; Ralph said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more dreaming here. No more dreams until the machine is fixed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;So, why don&rsquo;t you just fix the machine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Ralph laughed and Steven Wazen on the other side of the dormitory shushed to tell him to be quiet. Steven could sleep as well as all the other students in the room.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just fix the machine,&rdquo; Ralph said. &ldquo;If we could fix it, don&rsquo;t you think we would have fixed it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I guess. I mean, I would hope that would be the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Right. We can&rsquo;t fix it because it&rsquo;s broken and there&rsquo;s a piece missing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin knew the appropriate question to ask next but decided to let silence handle the conversation because he did not want to be seen as dumb.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;So, your next question,&rdquo; Ralph continued. &ldquo;Must be why don&rsquo;t we just make another piece.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Benjamin answered.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;And the answer to that question is that the dream machine has over one hundred thousand pieces. We do not know which piece is missing, at least that&rsquo;s what the parents in town tell us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t believe them. But, if this machine has been here for centuries, surely someone must have written down all of the pieces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Maybe there is a blueprint for how to make another one,&rdquo; Benjamin suggested without really knowing what he was saying.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Ralph replied quickly. &ldquo;But, Aloysius has it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Aloysius!&rdquo; Benjamin said loudly. Steven Wazen on the other end of the room shushed more loudly than he had earlier. Benjamin lowered his voice and in tandem, tried to lower his enthusiasm for learning more. &ldquo;Who is Aloysius?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; Ralph said between his teeth.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Everyone keeps saying that,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;But, I don&rsquo;t understand why.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;If you knew why, you would understand why we don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin rolled onto his back again and continued to stare into the darkness. He thought about Aloysius Trenhaile over and over and over. Without any details to create him in his mind, he tried to imagine what a person would look like that everyone else would not want to talk about. The only person that came to mind was Howard Horne. And, Benjamin decided, not thinking about anything was much better than thinking about Howard Horne.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Footsteps slowly made their way closer and closer to Benjamin&rsquo;s bed until a figure stood at the end.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You guys have to be quiet,&rdquo; Steven Wazen said with disgust. &ldquo;Just because you can&rsquo;t sleep, doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be quiet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Were you dreaming?&rdquo; Ralph asked with a smirk.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I was dreaming of dreaming,&rdquo; Steven replied with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As Steven returned to his bunk, Benjamin closed his eyes and decided that although he was happy not being at school, he wanted to be able to dream. And that in addition to missing his family made him realize that he needed to go to Bernard Zwirn in the morning and find out how he could take an earlier train home. This place was fine but it felt like there was not much adventure and that he would be happier if he went back.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The lights in the dormitory flickered on and off until they stayed on. Benjamin looked at the large clock on the wall and noticed that it was four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. It was two and a half hours earlier than they normally woke up. The lights never turned on before it was time to start the day.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>All of the boys sat on their beds and looked at the clock with even more worry than Benjamin had. They looked at each other and every one of them had an identical curl in the brow, each mirroring each others confusion.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Have to wake up!&rdquo; a brash voice yelled at the end of the dormitory. &ldquo;Have to wake up now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin looked and saw Noel Jaffin, Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s body guard, standing in the doorway with heavy armor covering his body. He looked like a metal cube, heavy enough that he could not be moved easily. And although the sight of a metal cube person was rather funny, Benjamin was a little unnerved that everyone else was unnerved. Noel Jaffin did not wake up the boys. That was Miss Lindenmeyer&rsquo;s responsibility. And when Miss Lindenmeyer woke up the boys, she did not appear dressed in armor. Noel Jaffin was not prepared for a day of learning. He was prepared for battle.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!&rdquo; he said as he pounded his short legs back and forth into the ground.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Slowly, boy by boy arose and got changed.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; Noel Jaffin yelled to the young children. &ldquo;This is not a drill!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;A drill?&rdquo; Benjamin said aloud.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We were told a day like this might happen,&rdquo; Ralph said with a tiny feeling of exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What might happen?&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Just follow orders,&rdquo; Ralph replied. &ldquo;And, you probably will be fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin was confused and now he was certain that he wanted to go home. Even if this was the adventure that he was waiting for, he decided that he no longer wanted it. He wanted the idea and dream of adventure rather than the actual reality of it. Waking up at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning was not an adventure. Seeing a guard who had previously tried to tackle him dressed in battle gear did not inspire adventure that Benjamin wanted. He was fine with bland adventures, he decided.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The boys lined up and Noel Jaffin checked their names on a sheet of paper on a clipboard as they passed him. In each case, Noel Jaffin had to stretch his neck backwards in order to see which child was which. As usual, Benjamin was last.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;d like to go home,&rdquo; Benjamin said as if Noel could somehow make this a reality.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going home,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said quickly and matter of factly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;d like to speak with King Bernard Zwirn about other ways that I could get home other than taking a train,&rdquo; Benjamin continued.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not taking a train home,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said angrily.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;No, I am going to take a train home,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;But, I&rsquo;d like to find a way to go home earlier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not taking a train home and you&rsquo;re not going home anytime time soon. King Bernard Zwirn has disappeared and without him, you&rsquo;re going nowhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin stopped. All of the boys in the line stopped. It was worse news that any of them had thought they would hear.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean, disappeared?&rdquo; Steven asked forcefully.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I mean that King Bernard Zwirn had disappeared. I am here to take you to your class. No more questions. Silence while we walk,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he marched to the front of the line.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>They marched, albeit at a slow pace due to Noel&rsquo;s short stride, from hallway to hallway in complete silence. But despite not being able to hear them, Benjamin could feel that something had gone so wrong that these otherwise happy and energetic children had suddenly become scared and concerned. And that, unfortunately, made Benjamin even more scared and concerned because he knew less than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As they made their way past the classroom, Noel Jaffin led them to another hallway decorated with paintings on all walls, ceilings, and even the floor. Benjamin stepped carefully from painting to painting of old men and women who lived in this castle previously. And oddly, each expression on their face looked more dire than the expressions he had noticed on their faces before.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Noel reached a painting of a woman wrapped in a red flag on a white horse whose two front legs flew into the air against a background of tan rocks that matched tan clouds. She pointed to the top left hand corner of the canvas. And that was where Noel Jaffin punched his fist through the canvas and pulled on a hidden lever, revealing an old circular staircase leading down.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Each of the boys filed one after the other while Noel Jaffin, again, checked their names against a piece of paper on a clipboard. Benjamin, again, was the last to depart but he decided this time that it was not in his best interest to ask Noel any other questions. Instead, he wondered how many other secret passageways existed in this castle. And, he wondered how many other secrets were there in general.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As he stepped down each curved stair, he imagined that they were descending several floors below the ground. It was dark, lit only by candles on the walls, mounted against cold rocks that were moist from whatever rain water had fallen below. After having turned six or seven times, Benjamin found himself at the end of turning. He stood at the opening of a massive, cavernous room that looked like it could hold as many people as he ever thought existed. And, it did. There were people everywhere.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>In front of him, however, was Miss Lindenmeyer with the girls from the class. As Miss Lindenmeyer welcomed the boys to join the girls, Selma Applebaum took a step forward. Benjamin knew, before she said anything, that she was the angriest of everyone in the room.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;This is all Benjamin&rsquo;s fault!&rdquo; she screamed.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.537q6ysubvjd"></a><span>Chapter 11: In Which There Is A Flying Machine</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt his body freeze. His face had no color and his arms felt like cement. He had just been blamed for King Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s disappearance. But worse than having been blamed, Benjamin did not understand how he could have been responsible. All that he knew at that moment was that he was not liked and that feeling that once again he had no friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If Benjamin wasn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum screamed as loudly as she could. &ldquo;This would never have happened!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer restrained Selma and pushed her to the back of the room. Benjamin did not know where to look. He wanted to find a friend, a dinosaur, amid the room but realized that he was all alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I go home?&rdquo; Benjamin muttered quietly to Miss Lindenmeyer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she cautiously pushed Benjamin towards the rest of the class. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t understand what coming here meant. You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did King Bernard Zwirn disappear because of me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course not, Benjamin. I would say that he would have disappeared whether you were here or not,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked around at the other students but none of them wanted to make eye contact. It was as if all of the kids around him thought that Benjamin would disappear if they did not see him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go home,&rdquo; Benjamin whispered to Miss Lindenmeyer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish you could,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;But, you&rsquo;re going to be stuck here for a little bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they were in a different location in different circumstances under different moods, Miss Lindenmeyer held her class as she had before. Benjamin sat behind everyone else who circled the teacher in that dark cavernous space. It was difficult for anyone to pay attention because there were people walking around and talking about what may happen next. The distractions were endless but for Benjamin, holding class was a welcome return to normalcy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Today, we&rsquo;re going to play with flight machines. We normally wouldn&rsquo;t but this space just so happens to have one of the tallest ceilings around, which makes it incredibly safe. No one is going to be flying to the moon,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students were happy about the idea of using flight machines. Benjamin did not know what they were but he was intrigued when Noel Jaffin wheeled a long clothes rack of odd shaped machines to Miss Lindenmeyer. They looked like a combination of a motorcycle engine and a broomstick, each of them painted green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks, Noel,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;Now students, grab a flight machine. Make sure you get your correct size.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched all of the students pick their flight machines and when it was his turn to pick his, there was only one flight machine left. He was not sure if it was his size or not. So, he took it and hide behind the other students.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer began to say with some caution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to use the flight machines,&rdquo; Selma said sternly to Miss Lindenmeyer, without addressing Benjamin himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step toward the clothes rack to return the flight machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said quickly and abruptly. &ldquo;Benjamin, watch Selma put on her flight machine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma was quite upset that she had suddenly been partnered with Benjamin. And Benjamin was quite concerned that his safety was being entrusted to someone who hated him. It was not a great partnership by any means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched Selma quickly settle into her flight machine and turn the ignition switch on. It made a louder noise than Benjamin expected but was not so loud that he needed to cover his ears. It hummed like a mechanical hummingbird would.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, we&rsquo;re going to fly one at a time,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;Because we don&rsquo;t want any more mid-air collisions, right Ryan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer had the students line up in front of her. One by one, she inspected the flying machines to make sure that they were working properly. She did not want a disaster to happen. A student could fly uncontrollably through the large room or even worse, a student could fly uncontrollably and hit everyone else in the room. Benjamin watched her inspect the machines like a mechanic had inspected his parents&rsquo; cars at home. Then when Miss Lindenmeyer was finally satisfied that everything appeared to be in order, she went to the first student and nodded with approval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Wazen flew into the air as his flying machine&rsquo;s engined churned a fine, soft buzz. It was not like the sound of a motorcycle or the sound of a locomotive. It was like the sound of a microwave and a kettle of boiling water. Benjamin watched Steven turn the flying machine to the left and then to the right and then to the left again. He flew fast, then slow, and then fast again. It looked almost graceful, Benjamin thought, as student after student flew into the air and around the room.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>To Benjamin, the entire ordeal, so far, was both exhilarating and frightening. This was actually some of the adventure that he was hoping to find. He wanted experiences that were different than his experiences at home and certainly, there were not many flying machines at home. And yet when each student successfully landed following an adrenaline-filled flight, he became more and more scared as he realized it would next be his turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said with the same confidence and enthusiasm she had said to all of the other students. &ldquo;Let me show you how this works.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer sat on the flying machine, pressed an ignition button, and then slowly ascended into the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Once you get this high,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer shouted as she began to turn around in the air. &ldquo;You lean forward to go forward. You lean backward to go backward. Left to go left and right to go right. It&rsquo;s actually quite easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it magic?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Selma shouted from behind him. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t magic. This is science.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she landed smoothly and then promptly adjusted her hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just science. We have a lot of machines here that you probably don&rsquo;t have in New York. They help us create more vivid dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin wanted to stall a little longer. He was not feeling as confident as the other students felt about flying one of these machines. He wanted a machine that could make him brave. Even if he was able to get the flying machine into the air, he felt he would then be defenseless and visible to all of the people on the ground who currently hated him. Certainly, someone would throw a rock or some fruit, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is a good idea, Miss Lindenmeyer,&rdquo; Selma protested as she flew into the air and coasted along the walls of the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer reassured him. &ldquo;The machine does most of the work for you. Now, just have a seat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nudged Benjamin into position, tied his seatbelt tight, and then fastened his helmet. As soon as he looked like someone who would soon take flight, Miss Lindenmeyer hit the ignition button without warning Benjamin that she was going to do so. He felt a sudden jerk of the machine and a sudden beat of his heart. The machine raised Benjamin further and further into the air where Benjamin first had a glance of the number of people in this space. It was tens of thousands over a length larger than his neighborhood. Although he still felt more comfortable on the ground, flying was more fun than he expected. It was also scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Miss Lindenmeyer advised, he moved forward as he leaned forward. He moved backwards as he leaned backwards. The machine sensed his movements and handled everything for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even grew enough confidence that he relaxed his tight grip on the handlebars and looked to the students below. Selma Applebaum, along with the rest of the class, had their arms crossed in front of them and their lips crossed as well. Benjamin wondered how long the battery would last because he would not mind flying home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer yelled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to turn off the machine from my remote control. You&rsquo;ll descend in a second.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer took out her phone and clicked a few times until the engine of the flying machine stopped. Benjamin waited to get back to the ground, entrusting his teacher to his safety. His teacher, though, looked at Benjamin with confusion and then looked back at her phone with more confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s off,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;You should be ascending.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked to the rest of the class whose contorted faces had suddenly taken on the same confused look that Miss Lindenmeyer showed. He was, he knew, descending to the ground. He was ascending and go further and further into the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer became more worried and she ran for a closet on the near side of the room. Benjamin looked to see where she was going and the flying machine turned with him. He pointed the machine down and it started to go down. Maybe, he thought, she just did not have cell phone reception in this dark hall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched his teacher return with a long rope. She then turn one end of it into a lasso. The other students had uncrossed their arms and now had their hands on their hips. Benjamin did not know what to make of their expressions other than something peculiar was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Catch the rope when I toss it to you,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer yelled.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>She threw the lasso up in the air and Benjamin grabbed it when it was near. She pulled and pulled and pulled with all her strength and Benjamin descended to the ground. As soon as he placed his right foot on the ground, the flying machine jerked and fell suddenly to the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer was exhausted, Benjamin saw. And the students, they were perplexed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, everyone,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she continued along with her class. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get lunch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone filed in a single line and started to march onward. As Benjamin passed Miss Lindenmeyer, she placed a hand on his chest so that he he had to stop walking forward. She looked from side to side as if she did not want anyone else to hear what she was about to say. Benjamin leaned forward so that he could hear her whispers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave my side or view,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer whispered. &ldquo;You were able to fly without the machine. You&rsquo;re in a lot of danger.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.639yu0weyub7"></a><span>Chapter 12: In Which There Is Evil</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in class treated Benjamin a little differently. He noticed that Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen watched him as if they were hawks staring at a little mouse. Selma Applebaum refused to make eye contact with Benjamin but he knew she was affected by him. It was impossible to ignore a student who was able to fly a machine when it was not powered on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t been done before,&rdquo; said one student. &ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I just kept sitting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you do that with other machines?&rdquo; another student asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Benjamin responded again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what other machines exist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you related to Bernard Zwirn Senior?&rdquo; another student asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Benjamin answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That would be amazing if you were,&rdquo; another student stated. &ldquo;Imagine we have in our class a student who is a relative of the man who made all of the dream machines.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bernard Zwirn made all of these machines?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;His dad did,&rdquo; Selma said as she continued to look forward at the chalkboard while all of the other students continued to look backward to Benjamin. &ldquo;But, he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And Bernard Zwirn is his son?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s three sons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are the other two?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; everyone said in exhausted unison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s life like in New York?&rdquo; another student asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too different than living here I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are there people everywhere?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And lots of food?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And people can do whatever they want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For the most part.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And everyone has dreams?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;But, I guess you would know better than I would.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Students,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she entered the classroom wearing a raincoat. &ldquo;We have to go to the general assembly area for an announcement. So I need you to line up in a single file and head outside. Raincoats on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student after student put on their coats and filed from the classroom outside into the unforgiving rain. There were people exiting what seemed like every building, all headed in the same direction toward the gigantic dream machine. Benjamin wondered what all of these people did each day. He did not know what every person in New York did and imagined students felt the same way about Castle Ehtahl. There were tens of thousands of people of various ages and sizes and colors gathered in one big plaza. The dream machine hovered over them like a tree that had spiralled upward without casting a single branch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin followed Steven Wazen and noticed that Miss Lindenmeyer, who led the group of students, frequently turned around to make sure that she could see him. When they reached a spot in the plaza with enough space for the class, Miss Lindenmeyer positioned everyone in a couple rows and then stood next to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are not to leave my side,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer responded. &ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s probably related to Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Does this happen often?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Selma replied. &ldquo;Bernard Zwirn liked talking to small groups of people rather than everyone at once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, who is going to speak now?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma shrugged her shoulders as if she did not care. At the front of the plaza, before the tens of thousands of people, was a green and blue stone building that towered almost nearly as high as the dream machine. The building reminded Benjamin of cathedrals he had seen pictures before. But, this building was much wider and much more detailed than any cathedral he had ever seen. At the very top, there was a balcony with a red flag hanging over the entrance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rain continued, projection screens were hastily opened throughout the plaza. Cameras turned on and focused themselves on the balcony. Lights flickered and flashed from all directions as sound checks began to test the limits of the speaker system. A hush came over the crowd as Castle Ehtahl&rsquo;s anthem began to play. It was a song that reminded Benjamin of jazz songs his dad would play on the radio while working on the family car. The rhythm was quick and the song was incredibly upbeat, Benjamin thought. It felt inspiring, even though Benjamin knew none of the words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the song ended, the lights were dimmed and a roar spread across the crowd from the back to the front. Even Benjamin got caught up in the excitement of what was to come. He noticed, however, that Miss Lindenmeyer was not energized at all. Her eyes were glancing from left to right in a fast enough manner that suggested that she was looking for someone. Benjamin realized she was nervous and that made him nervous. He trusted Miss Lindenmeyer more than he trusted the crowd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the balcony, the red flag was removed by two guards who looked to be much more qualified for their position than Noel Jaffin. The crowd erupted in anticipation like Benjamin had seen at music concerts on television. Benjamin expected, for reasons he could not explain, to see Bernard Zwirn enter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man did enter but it was not Bernard Zwirn. Benjamin did not know who it was but he did know the man standing immediately behind him. That was Russell Fox.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The crowd erupted in excitement and cheers and Benjamin was more confused. He did not see any reason to cheer for someone who was friends with Russell Fox. No one else must realize that Russell Fox was the reason that Benjamin was still there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My fellow Ehtahlians,&rdquo; Russell Fox projected into a microphone. &ldquo;I present to you the interim King, Thalia Nachamie.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd screamed and cheered. Miss Lindenmeyer did not flinch and Benjamin noticed that Selma Applebaum did not flinch as well. The other students in the class cheered as loud or louder than the people around them. And at that moment, Benjamin began to realize that everyone may have been cheering only because everyone was cheering and not because of the men who stood on the balcony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalia Nachamie was tall and skinny with a long face and a crooked nose. His dark black hair was seamless with the black clothes he wore and the black hat on his head. He looked, if Benjamin could name an animal, like a large crow that wore pieces of leather rather than feathers.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Ladies and gentleman,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie&rsquo;s voice boomed across the plaza as the rain continued to pour down. &ldquo;A great tragedy has come to our castle. Our very own Bernard Zwirn has been kidnapped. We do not know where he was taken and we do not know who has taken him. But, we will find him. And until we do, we will continue to do what we do best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Cheers erupted throughout the crowd and Benjamin&rsquo;s face turned pale as he heard that Bernard Zwirn was kidnapped. It was, he thought, one of the worst possible answers to where the king may have been. Kidnapping, to Benjamin, meant that there was someone as evil as evil could be in this castle. Bernard Zwirn held the key to Benjamin&rsquo;s departure and Benjamin began to feel queasy.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We are going to set a search party to look for Bernard Zwirn. We don&rsquo;t have many clues so if anyone knows what has happened, please contact me directly and I&rsquo;ll make sure to tell you whether your clue is valid or not. As you all know, if Bernard Zwirn is not found in a week, we will have to move on without him. We cannot wait around endlessly for his return because our dream machine is running low.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Thunder cracked in the distance and the rain became more fierce. Miss Lindenmeyer placed a hand over Benjamin as her eyes continued to move back and forth. But then, they stopped. Benjamin saw that she was looking to the left but he could not see what she had found.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;If anyone has any questions at this time, please ask them now,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie projected to the audience.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Is there a chance anyone else could be kidnapped?&rdquo; Russell Fox asked into a microphone behind Thalia Nachamie.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great question,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie continued. &ldquo;And there is a severe chance that every one of you could be kidnapped. So, it is important that you continue to do your jobs well and that you do not wander outside of this castle. If we cannot fix the dream machine, we will have to use another proposed solution. This proposed solution, as I told you last year, will make sure that you can make dreams and not be kidnapped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Will the dream machine be fixed?&rdquo; Russell Fox asked into the microphone again. Benjamin could see that Russell Fox was reading from a tiny phone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That is again a great question,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie began. &ldquo;We are missing a piece to the dream machine and we do not know what this piece is or where this piece is. It&rsquo;s possible that the dream machine has suffered damage beyond repair. But, we do not have any way of knowing whether we can fix it without having this piece returned to us. If you know the evil, villainous person who has stolen it, you must tell us immediately. We will not stand for evil in our castle.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What will we do if we run out of resources to make dreams?&rdquo; Russell Fox asked again, in the same tone and awkward reading style as the previous two questions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Another great question,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie started. &ldquo;We will not run out of resources to make dreams. If the dream machine fails, I will make sure we have the resources to make more dreams. You can count on that. I think that&rsquo;s it for questions. Have a great day everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder crashed and Benjamin was surprised that Thalia Nachamie ended his question and answering session because there were over a hundred hands raised throughout the plaza. Selma had her hand raised too and took it back down with disgust. Miss Lindenmeyer was still looking to her left and Benjamin noticed that she was trying to talk to someone by mouthing words and reading lips. He still could not see who she was speaking with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the crowd started to depart in various directions, Miss Lindenmeyer ushered the students back to the school where she was met by another teacher Benjamin had not seen before. Benjamin started to walk into the school but then Miss Lindenmeyer grabbed his hand. He saw that Selma was watching everything that was about to transpire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quickly, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer and Benjamin ran back into the crowd, which made Benjamin quite nervous. He did not know who to believe and who to trust other than Miss Lindenmeyer. Any of these faces looking upon him could belong to the person who kidnapped Bernard Zwirn. They zigged and zagged between one dark clothed body and another, getting wet from the rain along the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stopped. In the distance, he saw him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Snark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Miss Lindenmeyer!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dinosaur that led me here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Lindenmeyer looked in the direction that Benjamin pointed. He was thrilled to know that his reason for adventure was not lost. He could, in fact, figure out what the dinosaurs did here. They were among him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unexpectedly, Miss Lindenmeyer was not as excited by Benjamin&rsquo;s discovery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rodney,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said with a long sigh. &ldquo;We have to run, Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed his hand as a person would who was pulling an unwilling partner. Benjamin looked back over his right shoulder and watched Snark walk the other direction. The dinosaurs were here, he thought. He could find his friends and they could take him back home. They knew where he lived, he said to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having passed thousands of people, Miss Lindenmeyer approached the woman who she had been exchanging words with earlier. Benjamin knew her as well. It was Pritchett Pollock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You need to take him,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said to Pritchett Pollock. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t safe with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk here,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she glanced from side to side at the thousands of people walking among them. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to my office.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock and Miss Lindenmeyer started to walk in the same direction with Benjamin following. But as quickly as they began to walk, Pritchett put her hand out and leaned in to Miss Lindenmeyer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Walk a different direction than me,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock whispered. &ldquo;Meet in my office in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was pulled by Miss Lindenmeyer back into the crowd. He looked for Snark but didn&rsquo;t see him. He was here, though, and that was all that mattered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they eventually came to Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s office, Benjamin remarked that it was as organized as the day when he first saw it. He also noticed that Pritchett Pollock was staring at the pool of water Benjamin had brought into her office from the weather outside. He pushed it aside with his foot to no success. Pritchett Pollock took a towel from the window shelf and wiped the floor dry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pritchett, you have to hide Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one here that can hide someone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hide him? For how long?&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to hide him until we can find Bernard Zwirn and his key. Benjamin has to be on the next train home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why? What happened since I last saw him? Kids wind up here all the time, especially kids who had the luck of meeting Rodney,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said with a little sarcasm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin can fly on a flying machine without power. And, he&rsquo;s from New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s stern face turned the slightest bit aware and more open. She tilted her head up and to the side to indicate that she was listening and wanted to hear more. These subtle adult movements drove Benjamin nuts. He did not understand why they could not just ask for more information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was teaching the class to fly on the flying machines,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer continued. &ldquo;Benjamin went up as well and I controlled his flying machine from a remote control. He didn&rsquo;t know that at the time. When I turned it off and had Benjamin come back to the ground, he continued to fly around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe the remote control was busted,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock snapped back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t. I tested it again that evening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe there were strong winds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We were indoors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it was a fluke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pritchett, it wasn&rsquo;t. And if Thalia Nachamie learns of this, Benjamin is going to be in incredible danger. Thalia Nachamie will either enslave him or kill him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock touched her chin with her hand and examined Benjamin and the pool of water he was continuing to create on the floor. He was not sure why Miss Lindenmeyer trusted Pritchett Pollock so much with this information. But because he trusted Miss Lindenmeyer, he was starting to trust Pritchett Pollock a little more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hide him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;Do you know where Bernard Zwirn is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aloysius Trenhaile kidnapped him. It&rsquo;s too dangerous to try to get him back,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock replied. &ldquo;We may not see him again.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.w78tmbi78585"></a><span>Chapter 13: In Which There Is A Production Studio </span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Benjamin had already been to Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s office, he did not find anything remarkable about it at all. In fact, it was more boring than how boring he found it last time. And this time, he had to sit quietly while Pritchett Pollock typed on her computer. It was dreadful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the books on the shelf to his right looked interesting but as soon as he reached his hand over to take one, Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s fingers stopped tapping on the keyboard and her eyes stared at him until he returned his hand to his lap. He was so bored that he even thought about untying and tying his shoes over and over. But as soon as he leaned over to untie them, the keyboard typing stopped again. If he took a deep breath, the typing stopped until he exhaled again. If he stretched his arms, the typing stopped until he stopped stretching. And if he blew air through his lips like he was making the sound of a bumble bee, the typing stopped. It was the most boring place Benjamin had ever been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock began. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored!&rdquo; Benjamin said as he jumped to his feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sit,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;And, I can see that you are bored.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I saw one of the dinosaurs from my dreams in the plaza and I want to go find him. Will you help me find him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to work, Benjamin,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I go find him and then come back here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll get yourself in a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; Benjamin said as he sunk into the chair again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so bored and this is boring and this is not the adventure that I wanted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock looked at Benjamin in a way that suggested that she knew that she was not going to get any work done while he was in her office. Benjamin looked at Pritchett Pollock in a way that suggested she was not going to get any work done while he was in her office. They both knew that they needed to do something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, fine,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she daintily wiped any possible dust from her blue jacket. &ldquo;I have to go to the control tower in an hour anyways so how about I give you a tour.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;A tour!&rdquo; Benjamin jumped to his feet in excitement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting a tour all along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Pritchett Pollock took a deep breath and sighed heavily, just as Benjamin had done when he was sitting in the chair while she typed. He was far more excited about the idea of a tour than she was. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Are we going to go see dinosaurs in the wild? Maybe space shuttle launches? Will we see massive trolls yelling at one another?&rdquo; Benjamin said as he swung his arms from side to side.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We are going to see production studios.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin stopped his motion and tilted his head to the side.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Production studios?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, Benjamin,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she pulled an umbrella from behind her desk as well as an orange vest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show you where we make dreams. Before we leave, put this vest on so that I can see you at all times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The vest looked similar to what constructions workers wore when they worked on the television cable lines in Benjamin&rsquo;s neighborhood. There did not seem to be anything special about it. But, Benjamin was beginning to understand there was a lot more mystery around here. He inspected the vest from the inside and out. Pritchett Pollock rolled her eyes.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a vest,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin and Pritchett Pollock left her office building and entered another building immediately next door. Like Miss Lindenmeyer, Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s eyes moved back and forth quickly whenever they were around other people. Pritchett Pollock walked a lot faster than Miss Lindenmeyer and Benjamin almost had to jog to keep up.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;This is production building two thousand seven hundred and eighty eight,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as they walked down a brightly lit white hallway with hundreds of white doors on both the left and right. The hallway extended so far that Benjamin could not see the door on the other side. It was also so bright that he had to cup his hands around his eyes to see.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Two thousand seven hundred and eighty eight?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. &ldquo;How many production buildings are there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Pritchett Pollock stopped and looked to the ceiling as if she was counting them in the air.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; she said quickly as she returned to her fast walking pace. &ldquo;They come and go but somewhere around six billion I think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Six billion!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I think so. I actually forget. I guess I should know. But, I don&rsquo;t. The actual number isn&rsquo;t that important.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What is behind each of these doors?&rdquo; Benjamin asked as he reached for a handle.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s hand grabbed Benjamin&rsquo;s wrist tightly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said sharply but then upon realizing her tone, calmed herself quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open the doors, Benjamin. I&rsquo;ll show you what is inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>They continued walking down the hallway and by Benjamin&rsquo;s count, Pritchett Pollock stopped in front of the twenty-ninth door on the right hand side. She placed her hand on the doorknob and then looked Benjamin in the eyes in a more gentle way than Benjamin had seen from her so far. It was calming to Benjamin whose heart was racing with anticipation of what was behind these mysterious door.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;This is where a dream is created,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she opened the door and pushed Benjamin inside. She held her fingers to her lips and gestured to Benjamin to remain silent. He immediately understood why he had to wear the orange vest because there were many other people wearing orange vests as well.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>But Benjamin was focused on everything else. There was a large speedboat cruising as fast as it could go through a river that raged through a metropolis. A person sat in the driver&rsquo;s seat with a large smile, the wind throwing his hair back, and then sun bouncing light off his face. There were cameras everywhere capturing every angle and cranes holding lights and speakers above the stage. The speed boat roared as it switched gears and rocked back and forth as waves crashed into it. It went underneath bridges and passed sailboats and turned suddenly and headed the other direction. The metropolis looked like a metal forest that the speed boat moved through as quickly as it could. People in orange vests were moving the set as the man in the speed boat stood and then screamed with joy. Benjamin felt the joy the man must have been experiencing as everything here looked like so much fun. He wanted to ride a speed boat through a city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock opened the door to the hallway again and pushed Benjamin outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That was amazing!&rdquo; Benjamin shouted into the hallway. He only realized then how much his voice echoed in this space. &ldquo;Can I do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you enjoyed that, Benjamin. But, that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s dream. You can&rsquo;t just do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Someone is dreaming right now and that is his dream being played out. That was a production studio. Everything inside was orchestrated to make sure that person had a great dream.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I never saw cameras or lights or speakers or people wearing orange vests in my dreams. Do my dreams come from here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she walked faster down the hallway. &ldquo;In fact, your dreams are the most expensive and technically involved that we have to produce. You don&rsquo;t see the cameras or lights or speakers or people wearing orange vests because no one dreams in orange. You don&rsquo;t see anything in orange in your dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing is orange?&rdquo; Benjamin asked as he thought about that situation for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing is orange,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she placed her hand on another door knob.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin walked inside the next production studio and saw a ski slope higher than any building he had ever seen before. At the very top stood a skier whose smile stretched wider than her face. All around her, people in orange suits carried lighting instruments and speakers as the woman bounced back and forth. Before she leaped down the slope, Benjamin thought that she saw him, that they had exchanged glances for one moment. But before he could think any further, she moved down that hill as fast as that speed boat had moved through that river. Snow splattered and sprayed in all directions as she raced between trees, jumped over large rocks, and did flips in the air over bored brown bears. Benjamin could hear the calmness of the wind as well as the sound of her skis carving into the snow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock grabbed Benjamin by the shoulder and took him into another production studio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Benjamin awed at the propeller airplane dodging cloud after cloud that people in orange vests had sent into the air from their machines on the ground. The old grandmother inside the plane laughed as she maneuvered it from side to side and then into a full loop. Benjamin noticed his smile was widening as wide as the people who were experiencing these dreams. He was watching adventure. In each of these production studios, adventures were being created in the form of a dream. Everything before him was created by machines and people. The clouds, the blue sky, the trees on the ground, the birds flying past the airplane, and the sun in the corner of the room. He could not believe people could possibly make something like this. It was, in his mind, unbelievable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollocked grabbed him by the shoulder again and they returned into the hallway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Which one is next?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with excitement as he jumped from side to side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock pulled at her clothing until it looked perfect and then addressed Benjamin directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have ten minutes to get to the control center so we need to get moving,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have to work and you will be sitting next to me while I work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Benjamin was not excited about having to work, especially with someone who worked like Pritchett Pollock worked. It was more unbearable than when he had to spend time in his mother&rsquo;s law firm&rsquo;s office. He wondered if there was any other place he could be and still be safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Could I hang out in one of the production studios?&rdquo; he asked with eager anticipation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she continued to march forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Could I hang out with the people who make the clouds?&rdquo; he asked again while also thinking about his next proposal in anticipation that Pritchett Pollock would not approve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock responded quickly as she marched faster and faster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I see more dreams?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;You will be seated next to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Benjamin realized he did not quite know what Pritchett Pollock did. He assumed that by her office she typed on her computer to other people who typed on their computers. And, that was presumably what they did all day long. He did not think that she did something outside of that office.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with a pause between each word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am the director,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock responded as she moved her legs even faster. &ldquo;I direct dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a director?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And, the people who dream are my audience. We&rsquo;re taking a shortcut.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock pulled Benjamin through another white doorway and into a room with a large orange screen and people standing in front of it. They passed through the orange room and into a make-up room that looked like it had enough paint to cover all the houses in his neighborhood. They then ran through a prop room that had baseball bats and soccer balls and race cars and guitars and cooking gear and televisions and lots of deer and costumes and elephants and tigers and bunnies and anything else Benjamin could think existed. He marvelled over everything as they ran through another door and up a spiral staircase until they had reached a point where Benjamin could see everything in Castle Ehtahl below him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is the control tower,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she opened a door into a room with more television and computer screens than Benjamin had ever seen in his life. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost nine o&rsquo;clock in New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at his watched and confirmed that she was correct. It was, also, his bedtime at home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ready everyone?&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said to a room full of men and women seated before computers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going live in five, four, three, two.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin realized he should be at home and that one of these screens should have contained his dream. Instead, he was on the other side. He was beginning to see where dreams come from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;One,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said and all of the computer screens blinked at once.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.agsgkth5nu6p"></a><span>Chapter 14: In Which There Is An Attack</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin&rsquo;s eyes scanned across the thousands of television screens before him. There were as many production studios as Pritchett Pollock had said there were. She wasn&rsquo;t lying. And from the control tower, he could see into every one of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing all these dreams made him realize some things about himself. Whenever he went to sleep, he did not think that there would be hundreds of thousands of other people dreaming at the same time. But here, it was impossible to ignore because he was seeing all of the dreams simultaneously. It made him wonder if he was only thinking about himself sometimes, because he forgot that he lived in a world with so many other people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also realized that some people just do not have as complicated or adventurous a dream as other people do. There was a screen in front of him with a man standing on a bridge looking down upon waterlilies. There were no explosions or high speed chases or dangerous situations. It was just waterlilies and a bridge. And to the right of this screen, there was a woman looking at an owl, watermelon, pineapple, and coconut on a yellow table. Further along, there was a young child looking at a man on all fours carrying a gigantic basket of flowers on his back, that was strapped to him with a yellow cloth and supported by a larger woman. Benjamin realized that he expected dreams to be adventurous. He did not realize that dreams don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be what he called adventurous. He also did not quite know what to make of it because he found that he loved the more adventurous dreams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were car chases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And base jumping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And throwing fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chasing animals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dinosaurs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snark! Benjamin saw his friend in screen eighteen thousand, one hundred and four. It was him, he saw as he walked closer and closer. That was definitely Snark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled to Pritchett Pollock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock was standing in the middle of all of the people who worked for her. She was shouting orders for them to change certain screens or to adjust lighting in different ways or to increase the volume on certain sounds or to encourage more creativity in some dreams while telling actors in other dreams to cool it down. She pointed every which direction and simultaneously seemed to be talking to more people than Benjamin had ever known in his entire life. She yelled commands with such confidence and poise that she did not seem to sweat at all. Benjamin knew that if he was in charge, his heart would race and his mind would be overwhelmed with thoughts. For Pritchett Pollock, however, she behaved exactly as she behaved in her office. It was as if she had done this thousands of times, which she had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not now, Benjamin,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she quickly turned to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; Benjamin said without concern for what Pritchett Pollock was doing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Snark! That&rsquo;s the dinosaur from my dream, the one who took me here, the one I saw in the plaza.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock covered her microphone with her hand and leaned her head towards Benjamin ever so slightly. With a pause, everyone in the room turned silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said, her lips pursed as if to imitate an owl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The dinosaur from my dreams. Right there!&rdquo; Benjamin shouted as he pointed to Snark in one of the television screens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Expand one eight one zero four, please,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said calmly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The small screen where Benjamin had seen Snark expanding to fill nearly a quarter of the entire room. It was definitely him, Benjamin thought. He looked at Pritchett Pollock and she did not share the same enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Why is Rodney Cohen working?&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said into a microphone.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin did not know who she was speaking to but he could hear the brief sounds of someone responding back to her.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I told him that he was banned from working until he passes the safety and health test again,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said sternly into the microphone.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Rodney Cohen continued to be a name that Benjamin heard. He must be, Benjamin thought, the name Snark was referred to in Castle Ehtahl.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;Do I have to come down there and handle this on my own?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin could see that Pritchett Pollock was aggravated. Snark had obviously done something wrong but if it meant that Benjamin could finally meet him, it would be worth being stuck in Castle Ehtahl after all. Pritchett Pollock turned off her microphone with disgust and waved her hand in front of her eyes. Everyone who had previously been silent started issuing commands and orders to each other. Dreams continued to display over thousands of screens everywhere. Pritchett Pollock walked slowly to Benjamin and bent over to whisper in his ear.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I need to go talk to that dinosaur,&rdquo; she said slowly and tensely. Benjamin knew that Snark was in trouble but he did not know why. &ldquo;You have to stay here and I&rsquo;ll be back in ten minutes. You can watch me on that screen and everyone here knows to keep an eye on you. So, will you be fine alone here for ten minutes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Benjamin said, a little bit too eagerly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said without enthusiasm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back after I speak with the dinosaur.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I come along?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with earnest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she brushed the dust from her clothing and put on her jacket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was more exciting being in this room than being in her office, Benjamin decided. Although he did not know exactly what was happening, the dreams alone were so interesting that they appeared to make his imagination grow more vivid. He walked around in front of the screens and the people working at computers sometimes made noises that he was in their way. He would walk to the right and look at the screens but then someone would complain that he was blocking their view. So, he would walk to the left and look at the screens but then someone else would complain that he was blocking their view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where can I stand where I won&rsquo;t be in the way?&rdquo; Benjamin shouted to the hundred or so people working frantically on their computers and telephones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Over there!&rdquo; someone shouted from the back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Over where?&rdquo; Benjamin answered with his hands at his side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Near the broom closet on the right,&rdquo; the same voice shouted back among all the other shouts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Benjamin decided to walk to the broom closet which was just next to the last column of screens. If this meant he would not be in the way, he would gladly stand next to some brooms. Pritchett Pollock would be back soon enough, Benjamin thought, and he could not wait to ask her many questions about Snark. He wanted to know everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand gently rested on Benjamin&rsquo;s left shoulder and he was thrilled to realize that Pritchett Pollock was back. His first question, he decided, was to ask where the dinosaurs lived. But when Benjamin turned around, he saw quickly that the hand did not belong to Pritchett Pollock. It belonged to Russell Fox. And standing behind Russell Fox was Thalia Nachamie, wearing all black and nearly invisible when standing in front of the dark broom closet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, Benjamin,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said in a menacing voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin turned to run toward all of the workers but Russell Fox grabbed his shoulder and made a sign with his finger that Benjamin had better be quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run, Benjamin,&rdquo; Thalia said in a long drawn out voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to watch the dreams. Do any of them interest you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin did not want to speak with this man. He wanted Pritchett Pollock to return as soon as possible. He strained his neck to look at screen one eight one zero four but he was too far away now to see where she was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, I only have a question or two for you,&rdquo; Thalia said. &ldquo;What kind of child leaves their home to go to someplace unknown? Did you not know what you were getting yourself into? Did you not know what would be on the other side? Tell me, Benjamin, why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paused and looked back and forth throughout the workers for someone who could help him. No one seemed to be looking in his direction. They were all preoccupied with the dreams on the screens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Silent, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Russell Fox said. And at that moment, Benjamin realized that it was the same voice that had told him to go to the broom closet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to leave me alone,&rdquo; Benjamin said sternly. He was scared because he was defenseless against two people who made him feel very uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you alone, Benjamin,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said. &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t have a good reason for why you came here, I&rsquo;m left to assume that you came here for something. And, you&rsquo;re not willing to tell me what that something is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I came here for adventure,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly as he tried to wrestle his arm away from Russell Fox.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Adventure?&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie echoed with a laugh. &ldquo;Why of course. You&rsquo;ll find adventure here. But you&rsquo;re after something more, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin got one hand loose and started to move away but Thalia grabbed his neck with a strength that Benjamin had never felt before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to warn you once, Benjamin. There is no room for someone like you here. We don&rsquo;t take kindly to people who want to change the way we do things around here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to change anything!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled. &ldquo;I just want to go home!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go home soon enough,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said as he released Benjamin to the ground. &ldquo;But do realize, I have my eye on you and I don&rsquo;t take kindly to people who aren&rsquo;t honest with me. You had better stay out of my business, Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalia Nachamie and Russell Fox stared angrily at Benjamin as they walked into the broom closet and disappeared. Benjamin could still feel the tight grip from Thalia Nachamie and more than ever before, he wanted to go home. He was now aware of the danger that Miss Lindenmeyer said might come upon him. And, he needed to either run away or hide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said as she reentered the room. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t put your fingers on the television screens. Fingerprints are just about impossible to remove and it takes us hours to clean each screen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not even realize that he had been through an ordeal, Benjamin thought. He ran up to her as she continued to shout orders and commands to everyone before her and on the screens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pritchett,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he tugged at her pant leg.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, not now,&rdquo; she responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m danger,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I need to talk to you right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock put her hand over her microphone and leaned over to listen to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Russell Fox was here and he--&rdquo; Benjamin started to say. But as he began to speak, a loud noise erupted from one of the screens and several employees stood and pointed in the direction. Pritchett Pollock jumped up and began issuing new commands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Isolate it!&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;Isolate eight five zero!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s spreading,&rdquo; a worker yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Shut it down,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; someone yelled back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, shut it down,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at screen eight five zero. There was chaos. A man was hitting everyone in the scene and causing violence everywhere. He was acting ruthless and without concern for anyone&rsquo;s safety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock whispered to herself but in a voice loud enough for Benjamin to hear. &ldquo;We never get a nightmare like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nightmare?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That was a nightmare,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock responded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have walls around our castle. Now, what were you going to tell me about Russell Fox?&rdquo;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6">Chapter 15: In Which There Is Anger</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen waited for Benjamin to wake up in the dormitory before they began firing questions at him. They had been waiting for about thirty minutes, watching Benjamin sleep as all of the other children left. Little did they know, however, that Benjamin was doing his best to sleep as long as he could. He realized that being awake was only causing him trouble and that sleeping would allow him to pass time more quickly. There were too many people he did not trust and sleeping was his escape. The two children waiting for Benjamin to wake did not know his plan. And having the personalities that they did, they grew tired of waiting any further. They grabbed Benjamin&rsquo;s bed and began rocking it from side to side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Benjamin could not sleep through what was essentially a simulation of an awful boat ride. His eyes flew open and his body shifted forward as he put his arms in front to signal that he had had enough. But Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen had not noticed because they then became more occupied with shaking the bed than waking up Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you guys doing?&rdquo; Benjamin asked as he rubbed his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to wake up,&rdquo; Ryan Eden said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to wake up,&rdquo; Benjamin replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no school today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you were going to have to wake up at some point,&rdquo; Steven Wazen added with a snicker. &ldquo;And besides, we&rsquo;ve got some questions we want answers to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone has questions for me,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he found clothing to change into. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to answer any more questions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Wazen and Ryan Eden followed Benjamin as he walked across the dormitory like two snakes stalking a prey. Benjamin felt unease about their presence because they obviously had questions that he did not want to answer. And even though he could not stand up to Russell Fox or Thalia Nachamie, he also knew he could not stand up to Steven Wazen or Ryan Eden. There seemed, in Benjamin&rsquo;s mind, to be no weaker person in Castle Ehtahl than himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just one question, then,&rdquo; Steven Wazen continued, unphased by Benjamin&rsquo;s request for silence. &ldquo;Why is it that you want to be friends with dinosaurs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paused his walking because that question was more unexpected than all of the questions that raced through his mind. But he wondered what Steven Wazen was getting at because Ryan Eden laughed uncontrollably behind him. He could answer this question, he decided, because he was not scared of what he would say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We go on adventures together,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;They are my friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, they&rsquo;re in your dreams,&rdquo; Steven Wazen said. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re in my dreams,&rdquo; Benjamin replied. &ldquo;And, I thought they weren&rsquo;t real. But then, I saw one of them in my bedroom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Steven Wazen said quickly. &ldquo;We all know the story of how you got here. But you don&rsquo;t realize that you didn&rsquo;t see a dinosaur. You saw Rodney Cohen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone keeps saying Rodney Cohen. Who is Rodney Cohen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Benjamin. You really don&rsquo;t know? You can&rsquo;t be that dumb?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paused for a moment because he knew from his experience dealing with Howard Horne that there was no good answer to that question. If he responded that he was not dumb, that would be the expected response. But if he responded that he knew who Rodney Cohen was, he would be lying. Although he heard the name many times before, he still did not know. And so, Benjamin turned around in hopes that the question and the two boys would disappear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Gentleman,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he entered the dormitory wearing less armor than on previous days. Noel cleared his throat several times as if there was something lodged between his pumpkin body and his bowling ball head. &ldquo;Benjamin, follow me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are you taking him?&rdquo; Ryan Eden asked as he walked towards Noel Jaffin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business, Ryan,&rdquo; Noel said despite being nearly a foot shorter than the boy. &ldquo;Benjamin, you are to follow me at once. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin smiled inwardly as he passed the two boys and although he was not thrilled to see Noel Jaffin, he was thrilled to leave the dormitory. Whenever Noel Jaffin appeared, Benjamin knew that something had happened that was not very good. It was as if Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s arrival was a message alone that trouble was near.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Benjamin asked Noel Jaffin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin stated as he tried to lengthen his walking distance to match that of Benjamin&rsquo;s, &ldquo;are not going anywhere. I am going home to watch the football game. You are going to meet Miss Lindenmeyer and Pritchett Pollock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, there&rsquo;s no school today,&rdquo; Benjamin protested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are a smart one,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said sarcastically. &ldquo;But danger doesn&rsquo;t rest on the weekends and you&rsquo;ve got a date with two lovely women. I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, fine,&rdquo; Benjamin said because he did not want to hear any more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel Jaffin escorted Benjamin through a series of buildings and hallways that Benjamin had become more accustomed to seeing. He did not know which one but he knew that the guard was taking him to a production studio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, how do nightmares get in here?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin grumbled through his mustache. &ldquo;I suppose they come in here a lot like you came in here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin thought about that answer for a second because only at that moment did he realize that he may have been confused as a nightmare. If nightmares entered the way he entered, of course everyone would assume that he was one. It made logical sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard reached his arm above his head and grabbed a doorknob to open. It was studio two thousand and two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In you go,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he began to shuffle Benjamin forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, Noel,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Who is Rodney Cohen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rodney? Is he here? He&rsquo;s not supposed to be here! He&rsquo;s been suspended! Where is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no. Who is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rodney? He&rsquo;s probably one of the most incompetent actors we&rsquo;ve got in this castle,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he began to leverage his back to push Benjamin into the studio. &ldquo;Now, in you go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodney is an actor? Benjamin thought to himself. So, Snark wasn&rsquo;t real?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are my friends?&rdquo; Benjamin whispered to himself as he stared into the ground in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Over here!&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer yelled from the far side of the production studio. &ldquo;Oh, Benjamin! Come over here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin continued to stare into the ground as he walked forward as if walking slowly would dig up answers. He knew his friends weren&rsquo;t real. They were in his dreams. But, they became real and that was why he chased after them. Well, he chased after Snark. But now, he knew his friends weren&rsquo;t real. What was this place? Benjamin asked himself. Was nothing here real?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And, away we go,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock shouted as she turned on a flying machine and soared into the air. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done this in a long time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved every which direction as Miss Lindenmeyer used another machine to create clouds on the ground. She then turned on a fan which blew the clouds in the air so that Pritchett Pollock could fly between them. Miss Lindenmeyer and Pritchett Pollock were both laughing and Benjamin thought that it did look like fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this all fake?&rdquo; Benjamin asked them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer asked. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this all fake? Are my friends fake? Are these dreams fake? Is this castle fake?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, Benjamin, I think you&rsquo;re in a state where you can answer that question as best as I can. What do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anymore,&rdquo; Benjamin said very grumpily. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not true. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is all fake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, if it&rsquo;s all fake, why don&rsquo;t you just go home?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be all fake if you can&rsquo;t get rid of it, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin did not know but he thought that perhaps Miss Lindenmeyer had a point. If it was all fake, he should be able to leave. But, he couldn&rsquo;t. At least, he did not know how.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchett Pollock landed the flying machine next to Benjamin and then promptly brushed off the dust from her jacket and began straightening her hair. It was the most unorganized Benjamin had seen her so far. And, it was also the happiest he had seen her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been decades since I&rsquo;ve used any of these machines,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been directing all this time but I haven&rsquo;t had any reason to come down here and use any of these things. It&rsquo;s quite enjoyable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer began. &ldquo;We asked Noel to bring you here because we want to show you how to use these machines. I told Pritchett that you could fly and, well, we want to see if you can do that again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You want me to fly?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with concern. &ldquo;I promise you that I don&rsquo;t know how to fly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;And, I can&rsquo;t either. Fly, that is. But, perhaps under the right circumstances, you might be able to do something else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;With one of these machines?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, with one of these machines.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This one,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said, &ldquo;is made for surfing a gigantic wave. You won&rsquo;t get wet at all but you&rsquo;ll be able to surf with ease.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine looked like a metal basket sewn together with copper, steel, and iron. Orange lights lined the outside and blinked like a fluid dance. It looked mechanical yet organic and heavy yet light. Like all the other machines that sat next to it, it looked like someone had spent years piecing each individual component together. If it didn&rsquo;t cost a billion dollars, it looked like it was worth that much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hop on!&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said with enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin had not seen her so excited and thought that perhaps this was the way adults acted when they weren&rsquo;t working. Miss Lindenmeyer, too, was more excited than Benjamin had ever seen her. It was a welcome change from when the two women were so scared for Benjamin&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m ready to use these machines.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;Once you start it up, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything. You just enjoy the ride.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at the machine and wondered if it would bite him or guide him. Pritchett Pollock nudged Benjamin from behind but Benjamin did not move. Miss Lindenmeyer budged him and he still held his ground. He did not want to get involved with these machines. He wanted calm and anything that was less exciting at that point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when both Pritchett Pollock and Miss Lindenmeyer pushed Benjamin together, he fell forward into the arms of metal and lights. The machine enveloped him like a mechanical kangaroo would hold its baby. Without asking or telling him, Pritchett Pollock pushed hard on the ignition switch and Benjamin moved to an area of the production studio where the floor was beginning to separate down the middle. As the divide grew larger, water began to rush through in powerful waves that would have been perfect for an experienced surfer. It was not, however, ideal for a boy who was pretty much scared of everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine touched down on the water and Benjamin could not believe what was happening. He was surfing, albeit with a lot of help. But, he was actually surfing. This was something he did not imagine was possible. And more than that, he was awake and having fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He surfed for what felt like hours and then Miss Lindenmeyer told him to turn the machine off. It guided him back to the women who had their hands crossed and their smiles strewn from ear to ear. They looked as happy as Benjamin looked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I try another?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;That one will let you float in the air.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin ran to the machine that looked like a large mechanical crow with thousands of pieces. He turned it on and then started to float throughout the room. Miss Lindenmeyer sent clouds into the air and Benjamin felt like he was experiencing something much more enjoyable than dreams. He felt like he was experiencing something magical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is he doing up there!&rdquo; Selma Applebaum yelled from the entrance of the production studio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stamped her feet as she walked to Miss Lindenmeyer. Behind her, Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen marched with their arms folded and their eyes squinted. Benjamin fell from the sky upon seeing them and landed in Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you three doing here?&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to know why he is allowed to use these machines and I am not,&rdquo; Selma protested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, this is none of your business,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;You need to leave immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We told you Miss Lindenmeyer wouldn&rsquo;t let you use the machines,&rdquo; Ryan Eden said from behind Selma. &ldquo;Benjamin is being trained to be the top student in the class.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want you to be the best anymore,&rdquo; Steven Wazen said to Selma Applebaum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin did not know what to say because he did not know if that was Miss Lindenmeyer&rsquo;s intentions. He thought that he was going to learn more machines. He did not realize that he was using machines that the other students were not allowed to touch. But, Selma Applebaum knew this and tears welled in her eyes. She turned around quickly and ran from the production studio. Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen did not waste any time and chased after her. Pritchett Pollock and Miss Lindenmeyer simply sighed and gave expressions of disappointment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. &ldquo;Am I being trained to be the best in the class?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not being trained.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But anyone can use these machines,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he looked at the thousands of machines spread across the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;But, you are the only person we know who is able to use these machines while they are off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I turned them on before I used them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Those were buttons from my office. They did nothing. You flew and you carried a machine along with you as you flew. No one else is able to do that and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re in a lot of danger. You are a threat to Thalia Nachamie because you don&rsquo;t need to buy a machine to create a dream. You may be the most imaginative person in this castle.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.mfmhotgy1xoy"></a><span>Chapter 16: In Which There Is An Escape</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin had enough. If Miss Lindenmeyer and Pritchett Pollock wanted them to be their hero, he was not going to be a part of it. He had no problem being someone&rsquo;s hero, in principle. The problem he had was that to be a hero, he would have to do something remarkable and courageous. No one became a hero by being bland and predictable. And, that was what Benjamin wanted. This adventure was over and he was going home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dormitory, he wrote a note to Miss Lindemeyer and Pritchett Pollock in which he thanked them for their hospitality and for protecting him from what he did not know. And after he signed his name, he wrote that he wished he could also say bye to Bernard Zwirn as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was it, Benjamin thought. He left the note on his bed and exited the dormitory. He did not know where he was going but he decided that he could not longer stay here. Staying here was making him uncomfortable. He would go anywhere but where he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he looked at the sun rising above the green mountain, he felt free. Granted, he was still in the castle and therefore not truly free. But in his mind, he was independent and this was good. This was what he wanted. He didn&rsquo;t know where he was going to go or how he was going to get there. And for the first time in his life, he was fine with that. For the first time, he was taking control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are you walking?&rdquo; Benjamin heard the familiar voice of Selma shouting down the hallway. He did not have time to say goodbye to everyone he met and so, he continued to march forward. &ldquo;I said, where are you going?&rdquo; she shouted again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Benjamin picked up his walking pace, he heard Selma walking faster. He started to run forward and as he did so, he heard her sprinting after him. This was not, he thought, how he planned to leave. Selma could not get in his way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, she was faster than he was. Benjamin tried his hardest to move every muscle faster than they had ever moved before. It was the fastest he had ever run but it was not fast enough. Selma stood in front of him and would not let him pass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you deaf?&rdquo; she shouted into his face. &ldquo;I asked you where you were going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am going home,&rdquo; Benjamin declared and walked past her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma followed and laughed lightly as she did so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And how exactly are you going to do that?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t figured it out,&rdquo; Benjamin said honestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find Rodney Cohen and he&rsquo;s going to tell me how to get back home. He&rsquo;s the only person here who knows where I live. He&rsquo;ll show me the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma laughed again, more lightly this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, all Rodney Cohen will do for you is get you lost somewhere else. You&rsquo;re better off waiting for Bernard Zwirn to return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stopped and turned to the taller, stronger child standing before him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why do you care?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m telling you that you&rsquo;re stupid to think you can get back home with Rodney Cohen guiding you. He doesn&rsquo;t know his left from his right. I&rsquo;m not kidding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stay where I&rsquo;m not welcome so I&rsquo;m going to leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you do that often?&rdquo; Selma asked as Benjamin marched away into the crowds walking in the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do I do what often?&rdquo; he yelled back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you walk away from your problems often?&rdquo; she yelled back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin turned around sharply to address her but when he looked in her direction, she disappeared. He did walk away from his problems and he did not know why this was any of her business. If he wanted to walk away from problems, he would walk away from problems. That was, he believed, the only thing he could do. What else could he do? Nothing, he thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>People brushed by him from every direction as they walked to their destinations for the day. Some walked to the production studios, some walked to the market, and some walked to the cafes and bakeries that had opened only an hour earlier. It was a little chillier than usual that morning. But Benjamin&rsquo;s face at that moment was very warm because he was not happy with Selma Applebaum. She needed to mind her own business, he thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He was not, however, going to tell her this because he needed to leave.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He marched forward to the gate on the other side of the town that would lead him to somewhere else. He walked past the school, past Pritchett Pollock&rsquo;s office, past Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s house, and past the train station. And as he passed the train station, he closed his eyes as he realized that the building looked no different than any of the other production studios. Was it actually a train station? he asked himself. Or, was it another dream manufactured by these people? He was puzzled and then someone grabbed his left shoulder.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Ryan Wazen said without pausing for a second. &ldquo;Could you fly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Could I fly?&rdquo; Benjamin asked, angered that yet another student had found him on his attempt to leave. &ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t fly,&rdquo; he lied. &ldquo;Flying is impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Ryan said. &ldquo;Flying is impossible but that doesn&rsquo;t answer my question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a silly question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. Could you fly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Of course I couldn&rsquo;t fly,&rdquo; Benjamin lied for the second time. &ldquo;No one can fly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;People can fly but if you can&rsquo;t, I guess that&rsquo;s a shame. Miss Lindenmeyer was wrong about that kind of stuff before. Don&rsquo;t take it too hard, kid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean in the past?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;About kids that she thinks can fly. They usually can&rsquo;t. Some of them could, I was told. But, we never saw them again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Where do they go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know,&rdquo; Ryan said as he started to walk backwards from Benjamin. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it because you can&rsquo;t fly. Don&rsquo;t ask questions you don&rsquo;t want to know the answer to. That&rsquo;s what my dad always told me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Ryan ran off and Benjamin turned around to continue to walk to the exit. He did not want to know anything more about this place. There were too many secrets and too many people who confused him.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Guarding the gate were two men who looked identical to Noel Jaffin. They both had the same box shaped figure and short stature. Benjamin thought that if they did not let him pass, he might be able to quite easily topple them over.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; the guards yelled in unison. &ldquo;If you pass, it will only be by gas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;If you pass--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I heard what you said,&rdquo; Benjamin responded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite expect you to say that. I&rsquo;m leaving, Noel, so I would appreciate if you would open the gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Who is Noel?&rdquo; asked one of the guards as he stamped his wooden pole into the ground.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Are you Noel?&rdquo; the other guard asked the previous one.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Noel. I&rsquo;m Joel. Are you Noel?&rdquo; Joel asked the other guard.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Noel. I&rsquo;m Cole. Haven&rsquo;t we met?&rdquo; Cole asked Joel.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We stand her every day and we&rsquo;ve never introduced ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you,&rdquo; Joel said to Cole.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Same!&rdquo; Cole said he shook Joel&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;But you shall not pass unless you are gas!&rdquo; Joel and Cole yelled at Benjamin in unison.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you realize what you&rsquo;re saying,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he tried not to giggle.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;The only way you&rsquo;re getting through us is if you&rsquo;re gas,&rdquo; Joel said sternly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I know but you&rsquo;re saying--&rdquo; Benjamin began.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You shall only pass if you&rsquo;re gas,&rdquo; Cole repeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, I need to leave,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they yelled back in unison. &ldquo;No one leaves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>. Can I leave?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cole and Joel looked at each other with a puzzled expression. They looked as if they were pondering something their brains were not capable of understanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, this is interesting,&rdquo; Cole said to Joel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Interesting indeed,&rdquo; Joel said to Cole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Could this be the </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>&nbsp;that is allowed to leave?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible that if</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;no one</span><span>&nbsp;is allowed to leave and this child before us is </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>, he could leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That seems right to me as well but how do we know that he is </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He just said he was </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, right. But would </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>&nbsp;lie?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good point, Joel! </span><span class="c4">No one</span><span>&nbsp;tells the truth all the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So then, </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>&nbsp;is a liar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This child is </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>&nbsp;the liar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">No one</span><span>, you shall not pass!&rdquo; they yelled in unison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there another gate?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. He did not want to have to deal with Joel and Cole any longer. He was getting a headache.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course, there are four more,&rdquo; Cole said as he stamped his wooden pole back into the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are four more!&rdquo; Joel said with surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I really think we need a better onboarding process,&rdquo; Cole said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who guards those gates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Me neither!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin walked along the walls at a quick speed to find another gate. He did not want to have to deal with Joel or Cole if he could find an easier way to leave.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Good luck, </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>,&rdquo; Cole cried out after Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin walked between the castle walls and the back of small houses and production studios. It was a narrow alley that felt neglected compared to the rest of the clean town. It was muddy and there were bits of garbage tossed throughout. It made sense, he thought, because no one walked along this path. As Benjamin walked further, he wondered if the only people who would traverse this disgusting, claustrophobic path were the guards who tended the gate.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He had been walking for a good period of time and did not yet see an exit. The curved walls of the castle made him think the he might walk a full circle to see Joel and Cole again.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>His left foot stepped into wet mud that sucked his foot. He quickly moved his right foot to a rock and tried to pull his other foot forward. It was gross and disgusting and Benjamin knew that he would have to throw his shoes away after this was all done. It made a loud squishy noise like the sound he made when he tried to vacuum the water out of the bathtub when he was six.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>It started to make him laugh.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And, he would have continued to laugh except that he heard another familiar voice.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;But, what if I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; Benjamin heard Steven Wazen say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as good as the others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re stronger or better than the others,&rdquo; Benjamin heard Thalia Nachamie say. &ldquo;You are my son and you will follow in my footsteps. No other person or child is going to get in your or my way. Do you understand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin crouched as low as he could to the mud as he realized the noise was coming from the house immediately to his left.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I understand, father. I&rsquo;ll follow in your footsteps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already paved the path for you. Miss Lindenmeyer has been replaced. You won&rsquo;t be seeing her again and there is no chance that she&rsquo;ll get in our way again,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin&rsquo;s heart sank as he wondered what had happened to Miss Lindenmeyer. He had just seen her yesterday.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What about Selma?&rdquo; Steven Wazen asked his father.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to worry about Selma,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said. &ldquo;With Miss Lindenmeyer out of the picture, I&rsquo;ll be King. And then, you&rsquo;ll be King. This is a glorious time for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It is, father,&rdquo; Steven Wazen said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Now, run along,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said. &ldquo;I have to do some things to get ready for tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin kept his little body as close to the wet, sticky mud as possible so that he could avoid being seen. He was scared for himself. And also, he was scared for Miss Lindenmeyer. He wanted to know what happened to her and why Thalia Nachamie got rid of her. He did not know that Steven was Thalia Nachamie&rsquo;s son. No one said anything about that before.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>It was hours before Benjamin moved. He was as still as a clay statue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun setting on the other side of the castle cast a shadow over the path. He would be hidden, he thought, but only if he moved quickly. With his left foot hovering above the ground, he counted to three and then sprinted. The castle wall moved so quickly that he wondered if he could run this fast forever. He would have to because he did not know what was on the other side. He was prepared, he thought as he ran, to blast through whoever stood at the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exit in sight, Benjamin ran faster and faster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and ran straight through someone. The collision felt like when he accidentally ran into the basketball pole at home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What in all that is good are you doing?&rdquo; Noel Jaffin yelled at Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, is that you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin! What is wrong with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel had been knocked over like a beanbag chair thrown down a staircase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, is that really you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Benjamin. It is me, Noel. Who else would it be?&rdquo; Noel said. &ldquo;Now, would you mind telling me why you ran me over?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, Miss Lindenmeyer. Where is she?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel&rsquo;s expression changed and he looked from side to side quickly. He lowered his tone and he voice a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk about that here, Benjamin,&rdquo; Noel said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s missing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Missing!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quiet! Quiet!&rdquo; Noel whispered. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re in a lot of danger. It&rsquo;s good I ran into you. I wish you didn&rsquo;t run into me. But, I need you to wait here. I parked my car on the other side of the market. I&rsquo;ll be right here in five minutes. Do not move a muscle, OK?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin nodded as he looked at the hundreds of people moving throughout the marketplace. Noel disappeared into the audience and Benjamin decided that he could trust the guard. He had to find Pritchett Pollock to understand what had happened to Miss Lindenmeyer. He couldn&rsquo;t leave just yet, he thought. He needed to make sure she was OK.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he waited, he scanned across the people in the marketplace and recognized a face. Benjamin retreated into the shadow so that he could not be seen. It was Russell Fox.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell Fox was walking around very suspiciously. He was wearing a long dark jacket and had both his hands in his pocket as he moved from market shop to market shop. Benjamin watched him very carefully because he knew Russell Fox was trouble. As Russell Fox turned in place, Benjamin got a glimpse of something metal that Russell Fox was holding in his right hand. And then, Russell Fox walked to a stand covered in oranges and stood there for a few minutes. Something was very wrong, Benjamin thought. Russell Fox then stuck his right hand in the middle of the oranges and walked away quickly, in the opposite direction of Benjamin. And as he walked away, Benjamin noticed the metal piece was no longer in his pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Russell Fox faded into the crowded, Benjamin snuck quickly through the crowd to the gigantic stack of oranges. He put his hand into the oranges as the shopkeeper stared at him with an annoyed expression. Benjamin tried to be calm about it. He tried to find the place where Russell Fox placed his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he felt something metal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed it and waited for the shopkeeper to be distracted by another customer. Benjamin removed it quickly and put it in his pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he walked back to the shadow where Noel Jaffin was to find him, he took it out. He knew exactly what it was. He looked at the dream machine and realized he could help this castle after all. He found the missing piece.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6">Chapter 17: In Which There Is A Judgment</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled as the overweight guard drove a vehicle only slightly larger than his body to Benjamin. His car looked like a square, metal box in which Noel occupied just about the entire space. Once he parked, he leveraged all of his weight forward to get out of the vehicle like an elephant trying to squeeze itself out of a refrigerator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is it, Benjamin?&rdquo; a sweaty Noel answered as he brushed the dust from his pants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, I found something that could help me and help Ehtahl,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he gripped the missing piece in his pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right. Right. I&rsquo;ve heard this before. Let&rsquo;s just get you to the police station so we can figure out what to do with you next.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. This could answer all of our problems. The mystery of the missing piece of the dream machine is over,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he opened his hand to reveal the missing object.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel did not look convinced. He crossed his arms and tightened his lips, ultimately ending his bored performance with a heavy sigh. He picked the piece from Benjamin&rsquo;s hand and inspected it from every angle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is scrap,&rdquo; he said as he tossed it over his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin ran after it and caught it before it hit the ground. If the missing piece broke, then the dream machine certainly would not work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, this is the missing piece. We can put it in the dream machine and it&rsquo;ll start working again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How are you so sure? This is scrap metal. This doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we at least try?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Try what?&rdquo; Steven Wazen said from behind Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin did not know how long Steven Wazen had been standing behind him or how much he had heard. At that moment, Benjamin wanted to focus only on getting this metal component into the dream machine. He was worried that Steven Wazen might distract from this goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing, Steven,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said in response. &ldquo;Just another person among hundreds of thousands thinking they are special enough to have found the missing piece of the dream machine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He thinks he&rsquo;s found the missing piece to the dream machine?&rdquo; Steven Wazen asked as he stood immediately next to Benjamin. He had a skeptical and accusational expression that made Benjamin&rsquo;s stomach clench. &ldquo;How long have you had it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How long have I have it?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with a startle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just found it. I found it in the market. We have to see if it fits because this could answer all of our problems.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I see it?&rdquo; Steven Wazen asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paused. He did not want to give it to anyone else after having watched Noel Jaffin carelessly toss it over his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Steven Wazen continued. &ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stared into Steven Wazen&rsquo;s eyes and then glanced at the ground. Before he could hide the piece, Noel Jaffin let out a loud groan and yanked it from Benjamin&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand kids these days,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said to himself as he gave Steven Wazen the component. &ldquo;Here. Here is the scrap metal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Wazen inspected it in exactly the same way Noel Jaffin had just examined it. But unlike Noel Jaffin, Steven Wazen&rsquo;s expression became more and more intrigued and curious. It was as if he was understanding something that Benjamin could not see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scrap metal,&rdquo; Steven Wazen said quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said. &ldquo;Now, Benjamin, let&rsquo;s get a move on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I have it back?&rdquo; Benjamin asked Steven Wazen who still held the metal piece.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dispose of it for you,&rdquo; Steven Wazen said as he put it in his pocket and quickly ran away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said. &ldquo;That was really nice of him to offer to get rid of it for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was irate. He wanted to run after Steven Wazen but the boy had already become hidden by the crowd in the marketplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, that was the missing piece!&rdquo; Benjamin said in complete disbelief. &ldquo;He took the missing piece for the dream machine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scrap metal, Benjamin. You&rsquo;re not the first person to claim to have found the missing piece. You&rsquo;re actually the seventeenth person who claims to have found one today. Or, eighteenth. I&rsquo;m not sure. The sooner we get you to the station, the sooner we&rsquo;ll know what number you are,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he ushered Benjamin to the small car. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;re going to have both fit inside here. You get in first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at Noel Jaffin with disapproval. There was no room for anyone else in this car once Noel Jaffin was inside it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the most uncomfortable car ride that Benjamin had ever experience, his face squashed between the window and Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s hot, squishy belly. His legs were on top of each other and he could not move his arms. When they arrived in the station&rsquo;s parking lot, Benjamin felt like his body had been damaged in every place. It was excruciating and upon seeing Selma Applebaum at the station, embarrassing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Benjamin asked Selma as he tried to straighten out his bones and muscles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was arrested,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said without flinching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said as she walked past him. &ldquo;I was searching for Miss Lindenmeyer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel told me she&rsquo;s missing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum replied. &ldquo;Noel asked me to stop in the station to talk to some of the other guards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you know where she is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said. &ldquo;But, I have a good idea who is responsible for this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now. But for your own safety, you better stay out of sight. You&rsquo;re making quite a few enemies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making quite a few enemies!&rdquo; Benjamin exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been nice to everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not everyone thinks that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin called from his office on the other end of the station. &ldquo;Get in here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See you later, Benjamin,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said as she left the station.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, wait! I forgot to tell you--&rdquo; he started to say but it was too late. Selma Applebaum had already left and could not hear him. He should have mentioned the missing component earlier, he thought, because maybe she could get it from Ralph Eden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin walked along the blue carpet lined with yellow desks and cubicles until he reached Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s office. The room was, sadly, only slightly larger than Noel Jaffin. Benjamin paused at the door, took a large sigh, and then squeezed his way between a small space between the desk and a wall. There was only a little bit more space than there was in the car. But unlike the car, Benjamin and Noel Jaffin sat face to face, only inches away from touching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, we&rsquo;ve got to find a way to hide you for a bit,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin wanted to end this conversation as quickly as possible so that he could leave the office.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, OK. Let&rsquo;s do it,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, so I&rsquo;ll just arrest you and we&rsquo;ll put you in a jail cell for the time being. No one is going to bother you there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait. Arrest me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep, I&rsquo;ll arrest you for assault or something. I&rsquo;ll tell people who you hit me. Ouch!&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said with a hearty chuckle. Benjamin could feel the heat of the laugh on his face. It was disgusting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just put me in a jail cell?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he asked the question because he did not want to be in a jail cell at all. There must be a better option, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said while shaking his head. With each turn of his neck, Noel Jaffin almost hit Benjamin with his nose. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t put innocent people in the jail cells.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I am innocent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s why I said I would tell people who you assaulted me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I haven&rsquo;t assaulted you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. OK, hit me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hit me,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he squinted his eyes and lifted his shoulders in preparation of Benjamin hitting him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hit you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hit me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Punch me in the face!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin wanted to punch Noel Jaffin in the face. But, he knew he couldn&rsquo;t do it. If he went to jail for a crime that he did in fact commit, he would be in even more trouble than he was now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he opened his eyes and relaxed his body. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell people who you punched me in the face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I didn&rsquo;t. Can&rsquo;t you put me somewhere else than a jail cell?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There is no other place in this castle that is as safe and secure as our jail cells. No one will bother you there. The only other place is the zoo but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll like it there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a zoo?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s over--&rdquo; Noel Jaffin began to say until a woman twice Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s size entered the doorway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin swallowed hard. There was no more space in this office. He would be crushed if she wanted to sit inside the office as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, may I have a word with you?&rdquo; the enormous square woman said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, boss, sure,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said to her. &ldquo;Stay here, Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel Jaffin squeezed his way out of the office, causing Benjamin to feel crushed between the desk and the wall. His body had not endured so much torture as it had from this large man in such small environments. Benjamin breathed heavily in an attempt to get his health back in order. The office walls had pictures and books that had been squashed like flies against the white paint. A plant looked like it was flattened against the window and Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s chair looked like it had been through several wars. It was losing the battle against Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s weight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he reentered the doorway. Benjamin hoped that Noel Jaffin and his boss were not about to both enter the office. &ldquo;We have to go for a castle meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll be here,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re coming along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked to the plaza and to Benjamin, it felt nearly identical to the setting when Thalia Nachamie addressed all of the town. The entire castle&rsquo;s population was standing and sitting around while some workers were scrambling to erect screens and speakers. Noel Jaffin did not have the same expression of worry that Miss Lindenmeyer had the last time Benjamin was here. Instead, he kept looking at his watch while shuffling a candy bar in his other hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is this for?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin replied. &ldquo;But, it better not get in the way of lunch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When is lunch?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When isn&rsquo;t it lunch?&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said with a hearty laugh. &ldquo;Twenty minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked around the audience for someone he knew but like last time, did not see anyone. There was no Miss Lindenmeyer. No Pritchett Pollock. No Selma Applebaum. And, no Steven Wazen or Ryan Eden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, however, someone he had recognized before. On the opposite side of the plaza, Benjamin saw Rodney Cohen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, that&rsquo;s Rodney!&rdquo; Benjamin said to Noel Jaffin. &ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Argh, Rodney Cohen,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said. &ldquo;Stay away from that man, Benjamin. His incompetence is contagious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Incompetence?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rodney Cohen makes problems, despite his best efforts to not make problems.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin strained his neck to see where Rodney Cohen was walking. If he knew where Rodney was going next, he could meet him once this announcement ended. As Benjamin thought he watched Rodney enter a door to a large building, the audience stood and jumped with excitement. A roar of cheers waved across the people as Benjamin looked to the balcony to see who was going to speak to the crowds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Thalia Nachamie. Benjamin expected to see him and hoped that he was standing far away that the evil man would not be able to see him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, two more people stepped onto the balcony. Benjamin did not expect to see these two and his heart slowed with a little worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Ryan Eden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind Ryan Eden, it was Steven Wazen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are they doing up there?&rdquo; Benjamin muttered to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as he nudged Benjamin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to find out if they&rsquo;ve found Bernard Zwirn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalia Nachamie hit his hand against the microphone three times, causing all of the speakers around the audience to pop in response. He leaned forward and with his long, crane-like nose hooking over the microphone began to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have not found our beloved King Bernard Zwirn,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said to the cries of the audience below. &ldquo;But, our efforts are not in vain. We are continuing to search for him. We search in the night. We search in the day. We are searching all the time. And so, it is with my deep regret that I must be made king. It is not by my choosing, of course. It is to make sure that dreams are available to all that go to sleep at night. You see, without a King, this castle does not have a leader. And without a leader, there are no dreams. Today, I present myself, King Thalia Nachamie, the leader of Castle Ehtahl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Thalia Nachamie stopped talking, the crowd remained silent for a few seconds until Russell Fox began to clap. When Russell Fox clapped, people around him started to clap. And then, people around those people started to clap. And this persisted until the entire audience was clapping for Thalia Nachamie, their new king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My followers, I want to let you know that even though I am now King, that does not mean that we will stop looking for Bernard Zwirn. In fact, it is quite important that we not be stopped in our plan to continue searching for our friend. For you see, good people, there is one person among all of you who is hindering our progress. There is one person among all of you who does not want us to find Bernard Zwirn. There is one person who is trying to steal from us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasps and whispers spread throughout the audience. Even Benjamin wondered what Thalia Nachamie was alluding to. If anyone was in the way of searching for Bernard Zwirn, Benjamin thought, it was Thalia Nachamie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Only this morning, I was made aware of this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalia Nachamie turned around and Steven Wazen handed his father the missing piece of the dream machine that Benjamin had only hours earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the piece,&rdquo; Benjamin told Noel Jaffin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; Noel asked as he looked at his watch again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the missing piece of the dream machine that you said was scrap metal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel Jaffin did not say anything. He looked forward, squinting his eyes to see if Benjamin was, in fact, correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There is someone in this audience who had the missing piece of the dream machine all along,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie&rsquo;s voice echoed through the plaza. &ldquo;This person did not want us to have it. He wanted to keep it for himself. He wanted to make sure the dream machine never worked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That was Russell Fox,&rdquo; Benjamin whispered to Noel Jaffin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s who I saw put it in the market stand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Shh, quiet down,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said to Benjamin. &ldquo;I may have to make an arrest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Someone in our castle is preventing us from making dreams. Someone has been putting us through turmoil all along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The audience stirred.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;But my followers, I am proud to say that we have identified the person. And, we are going to exile him from our castle. He is no longer welcomed here and we will not have him among us any more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers and applause echoed throughout the plaza. Benjamin strained his neck to see where Russell Fox was, but he was not standing in the same location as he was before. Benjamin looked in every which direction to find where the thief went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That person will be punished!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd screamed loudly.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;He will be removed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The crowd raised their fists in the air.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;He is no longer welcome here!&rdquo; Thalia Nachami raised his fist into the air as he finished each sentence.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The crowd cheered.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;He must leave immediately and go outside these castle walls! Benjamin Buckingham, that means you!&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.cxys6y2jl07b"></a><span>Chapter 18: In Which There Is A Departure</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was thrilled. He wanted to leave the castle all along and finally, he was being granted his request. He was not thrilled with the way in which he would be leaving. He had hoped that he everyone would be smiling and happy and that a few people would have tears in their eyes as he departed. No one had tears in their eyes. Instead, everyone was squinting their eyes at Benjamin with intense hatred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, Benjamin had a hard time not smiling himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was leaving. He was finally leaving. This was the best moment so far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you smiling?&rdquo; Selma Applebaum whispered to Benjamin as the large crowd in front of him began to create a path for him to walk to the gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m finally out of here. I get to leave the castle,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You need to stop smiling,&rdquo; Selma said sternly between her teeth. &ldquo;You are making people very angry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do I care?&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never see any of these people again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into,&rdquo; Selma said quickly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s on the other side of those walls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s on this side of the wall and it isn&rsquo;t my home. If it&rsquo;s not here, it must be out there,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he tried to rationalize his enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t stop grinning. He was smiling from ear to ear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, he did not want to make anyone angry. He was just so happy. And everyone was certainly angry. There was no disputing that. The people in front of him were angrier than any people Benjamin had ever seen before. There were so many reasons to be happy right now that Benjamin did not care what anyone else thought of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not even care what Thalia Nachamie thought of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin Buckingham,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie stood in front of the exit. &ldquo;You are hereby banished from this castle and you are never to return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He emphasized every other word with spit and a clenched fist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie stared deep inside Benjamin&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You shall never return!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep, I shall never return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You shall not be welcome back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep, I shall not be welcome back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You shall live forever with nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What? Nightmares? Where?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Leave! Now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalia Nachamie turned to the guards standing behind him. Noel, Joel, and Cole all turned a steel wheel as quickly as their short bodies could turn it. The wheel was nearly double their size and as one of the guards pulled, another was lifted up into the air until he let go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was going home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel, Joel, and Cole opened the door nearly halfway when Thalia Nachamie motioned for them to stop. The guards were dripping in sweat and breathing like dogs having chased tennis balls for hours. Thalia Nachamie had decided that there was enough room for Benjamin to exit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, all of the people in the plaza turned their heads and stared at Benjamin. He had never had such attention in his life as he had at that moment. He was the most popular person in the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took one step forward and Selma Applebaum tugged at the back of his shirt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can still apologize,&rdquo; she whispered quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can apologize. If you apologize, they may let you stay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why would I want to stay?&rdquo; Benjamin whispered back as he took another step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said slowly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s on the other side of the walls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he took another step forward. &ldquo;But, I know what isn&rsquo;t here. I have a better chance of getting home out there than I do here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said with a sense of warning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t but I&rsquo;m willing to take my chance. If you haven&rsquo;t noticed, I am not very popular right now,&rdquo; he whispered as he waved to more people who were sneering at him as he passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said as she disappeared into the crowd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin saw some of his classmates in the crowd along with several actors he had seen in the production studios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; he said casually to a group of women on his right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have a good day,&rdquo; he said to some men on his left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie said as Benjamin approached the gates. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, alright,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he skipped forward to the door. &ldquo;So long, Noel. So long, Joel and Cole.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So long, </span><span class="c4">no one</span><span>,&rdquo; Joel and Cole said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Be gone with you!&rdquo; Thalia Nachamie yelled as he pushed Benjamin through the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever come back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was being pushed forcibly through the exit. He went through the gigantic iron doors with the largest smile on his face that he could remember.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, the guards trampled on top of each other to close the door. Benjamin listened to the straining metal door as it whined in pain. When it was finally closed, it let out a short thud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Benjamin heard applause and cheering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaza from which he left had erupted in happiness and excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hurt Benjamin&rsquo;s heart. He did not want to be hated. No one wanted to be hated. But Benjamin especially did not want to be hated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fine, he thought to himself, because he would never see those people again. He could finally go home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he looked at the area outside the castle, he did not know exactly where to begin. It was not as bright and lovely and beautiful as he had expected. Instead, it was a desert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn&rsquo;t a living plant as far as Benjamin could see. There was no water or even any animals. There was just dirt and cracks in the ground and the sound of the sun baking the earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, Benjamin thought, he did not know what he was getting himself into.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t think about that now. The decision had been made. He was now on the other side of the castle. The door behind him was closed and Benjamin could hear the guards closing more doors and then raising a bridge and then closing another door and then pushing heavy objects behind the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not welcome to return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not want to go back, even if they wanted him to return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Incoming!&rdquo; Benjamin heard Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s voice yell from behind the walls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin turned and upon seeing something in the sky heading in his direction cowered in fear. He was now being attacked! They were throwing things at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it hit the ground, Benjamin saw it was a backpack. He ran over to it and opened it up to find a bottle of water and more arrows than Benjamin thought could fit in the backpack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Incoming!&rsquo; Benjamin heard Noel Jaffin&rsquo;s voice yell again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, another object headed straight for Benjamin who ducked away as quickly as he could. This object, he realized, was a bow and a guide to edible plants outside the castle. It was actually entitled </span><span class="c4">A Guide To Plants Outside The Castle Not That You&rsquo;ll Ever Need This Because Everyone Stays In The Castle</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel must know something that Benjamin doesn&rsquo;t, he thought. And for that, whatever these gifts were, Benjamin said thank you to the castle wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quiet villain!&rdquo; Noel yelled back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin chuckled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks, Noel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that, he was on his own. He turned and walked into the desert as alone as a person could be. He took five steps and the feeling of loneliness began to replace the feeling of excitement and happiness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had no idea what he was doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was him, the desert, and his thoughts.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.aqea3fhk4fyo"></a><span>Chapter 19: In Which There Is A Squirrel</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time around, Benjamin did not want to see dinosaurs. If he saw one of those gigantic creatures here, it was undoubtedly going to be because the lizard wanted to eat him or stomp on him. The desert was no place for fun. It was ruthless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, certainly, there was no desert near his home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he walked further into the dry emptiness, the cold castle behind him faded into the distance until he reached a point in his walking where he could see nothing in the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin reached into the backpack for some water. As he drank some, he knew that he had to save more for later. There was no water fountain for as far as he could see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put it back in the backpack and upon doing so, realized that there was a piece of paper at the bottom of the bag. He took it out and upon unfolding it, he saw that it was a crudely drawn map. In large letters in the lower right hand corner was the name </span><span class="c4">Noel</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle was in the center. To the north of the castle was a forest. Noel had drawn some terrible looking trees. To the south were the words </span><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t go here!</span><span>&nbsp;and to the east were the words </span><span class="c4">You&rsquo;ll die here!</span><span>&nbsp;and to the west were the words </span><span class="c4">Worse than the other two!</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin decided that he would walk to the forest but he didn&rsquo;t see any forest in site. Was he walking north? He didn&rsquo;t know. He hoped so because Noel made it very clear that north was the only direction to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Benjamin pondered which way to go, he heard a faint noise from behind him. He squinted his eyes but could not see what was making the commotion. It sounded like an air conditioner in the distance getting louder and louder. Benjamin squinted more and noticed a trail of dust being sent into the air by something moving along the land at a fast speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was coming right at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin picked up the backpack and ran as fast as he could away from whatever was chasing him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humming noise was getting louder and the trail of dust was getting closer. Benjamin ran faster but he could not run fast enough. The sound was beginning to take the shape of a siren. Something was going to run him over soon enough. He crouched to the ground and braced himself for impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;North! North! North!&rdquo; yelled a squirrel as it ran past. &ldquo;North! North! North! North!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin opened his left eyes and saw the squirrel sprint off as dust and dirt flew into the air. He had never seen a squirrel move as fast as that squirrel had moved. He also had never heard a squirrel speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait! Wait!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;North! North! North! North!&rdquo; the squirrel kept yelling in the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin ran in the same direction but could not maintain the same speed that the squirrel maintained. It was as if the squirrel had an engine. At least, Benjamin thought, he knew where north was. He walked forward and about two hours later, he saw a forest on the horizon and no speaking squirrel in site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest began to expand to the left and to the right of the horizon as Benjamin approached it. It seemed to be as wide as Benjamin could see. And on the edge of the desert, about a hundred feet from the start of the forest, was a wooden stand with a large sign at the top that read</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Information Desk</span><span>. It was peculiar, Benjamin thought, because there was nothing else out here. He approached the stand and saw that there were maps, brochures, and even coupons for a variety of discounts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on top of the counter was a silver bell with a note that said to ring for assistance. Benjamin certainly needed assistance. So, he rang the bell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the forest swayed as if a wide wind had swept across the land. The trunks of the trees moved back and forth while the foliage on the ground moved into the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked into the forest to see what would happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why hello there!&rdquo; Benjamin heard a voice but he could not see the speaker.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello there! How are you?&rdquo; the voice said again. It was loud enough to be a person but Benjamin could not see who was speaking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello? Where are you?&rdquo; Benjamin asked as he strained his head to look around and around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here! How are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right where?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where is here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here? This is the forest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, where are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m on the information desk. Welcome to the information desk! I don&rsquo;t get many visitors but that does not mean I am not well trained in the art of customer service.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at the desk and saw a green caterpillar the size of his thumb. It was standing on its end and speaking to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a caterpillar!&rdquo; Benjamin said in surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a human!&rdquo; the caterpillar responded in mock surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And you can talk?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And </span><span class="c4">you</span><span>&nbsp;can talk?&rdquo; the caterpillar responded again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never heard a caterpillar talk before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Trust me, son. You&rsquo;re going to see some things you&rsquo;ve never seen before out here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Out here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, outside the castles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Castles? There&rsquo;s more than one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, my. You can&rsquo;t be from here. You&rsquo;ve got so many questions. Where are you from if you don&rsquo;t mind my asking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;New York,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly. The caterpillar&rsquo;s green face turned white and the leaves stopped swaying and the tree trunks stopped shaking. Everything had come to a standstill. &ldquo;Why does everyone react this way when I say I&rsquo;m from New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sh! Sh!&rdquo; the caterpillar yelled as it held its finger to its lips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so loud!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen just because you&rsquo;re from New York doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to tell people from here you&rsquo;re from New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, so you&rsquo;re from New York. What in the universe of dreams are you doing here?&rdquo; the caterpillar had its hands on its hips and was tapping its right feet on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am trying to leave. I&rsquo;m trying to go back to New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sh! Sh!&rdquo; the caterpillar hushed Benjamin. &ldquo;OK, OK. That makes sense. How did you ever get here in the first place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin began to open his mouth to explain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; the caterpillar quickly responded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably best if I don&rsquo;t know about it. What is your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My name is Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Myrna Delacourte. Now let me see here,&rdquo; Myrna said as she rummaged through the brochures and informational papers properly organized in the information stand. &ldquo;Forest. Forest. Forest. Going north. Things not to eat. Things to eat. Things best left untouched. Sorry, Benjamin. I don&rsquo;t have any information guides for New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a guide for getting to New York. I need a guide to leave here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Myrna responded with shock. &ldquo;This may not be the cleanest or the coolest or the hippest or the healthiest place but it is not the worst, either!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I mean I have to go home and if I can get to anywhere with a plane, train, or bus, I can get back to New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sh! Sh! We have planes, trains, and buses,&rdquo; Myrna said as she went through her papers again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Will they take me to New York?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t take you to New York!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Benjamin paused. &ldquo;So how can I get home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re going to have to start by going through the forest. Is that a map you have?&rdquo; Myrna pointed to Noel&rsquo;s map in Benjamin&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Let me see it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myrna put on a pair of glasses and made disapproving facial expressions at the map.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Myrna said as she folded the map and returned it to Benjamin. &ldquo;That is certainly the worst drawn map I&rsquo;ve ever seen. First of all, those don&rsquo;t even look like trees. And secondly, you&rsquo;re lucky to have found this place to begin with. How did you know which way was north?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A squirrel ran by screaming North! North!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Gerald!&rdquo; Myrna said between her teeth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so noisy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How is it that you and a squirrel can talk?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How is it that </span><span class="c4">you</span><span>&nbsp;can talk?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Someone taught me to speak, I suppose. My parents taught me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, some people taught </span><span class="c4">us</span><span>&nbsp;to speak, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing! Who?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So long as you don&rsquo;t say where you&rsquo;re from again, I&rsquo;ll explain a little bit. Were you in a castle?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Castle Ehtahl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right, OK. So, there are these castles that make dreams. Castles for day dreams and castles for nighttime dreams. But, there are also castles that make nightmares and really, really bad dreams. Castle walls that make dreams keep the nightmares outside and keep the dreams inside. You are in between castles. This is where things or people go when they aren&rsquo;t wanted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not wanted?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to presume that you did something that&rsquo;s led you to be kicked out of Castle Ehtahl. Otherwise, they would have sent you back to,&rdquo; Myrna looked side to side and then whispered. &ldquo;New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t do anything but I was accused of doing something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, same thing. You&rsquo;re out here like the rest of us. All of us have either done something or been accused of doing something and now no one wants us. So, we live out here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What did you do, Myrna?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myrna stared Benjamin in the eyes, standing approximately three inches tall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I killed a guy,&rdquo; Myrna said sternly. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m kidding! I have to have fun out here. I don&rsquo;t get to see that many people. No, no, I ate an apple and apparently it was someone&rsquo;s very special apple and they were all like &lsquo;you ate our apple!&rsquo; and I was like &lsquo;it was delicious&rsquo; and now, here I am. It&rsquo;s not a bad life. I&rsquo;ve got all these informational brochures ready to give to people who journey through.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin could see that Myrna did not want to be where she was. She was not as happy handing out informational brochures as she said. He knew she wanted to be back in whatever castle that had kicked her out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So the space in between castles, that&rsquo;s the space for things in transition. We&rsquo;re not wanted by the people who knew us. And, we haven&rsquo;t found anyone else who wants us yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe you could apologize?&rdquo; Benjamin offered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Apologize for eating the apple? Oh, Benjamin, if only it was that easy. I&rsquo;m fine here. It&rsquo;s not so bad. I do miss my family but that&rsquo;s another thing and let&rsquo;s get you on your way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your fam--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, the easiest way out of here is straight through that forest. After that, you&rsquo;re going to have to get back into a castle so that they can get you out of here. Since you&rsquo;re from,&rdquo; Myrna leaned over and whispered, &ldquo;New York, that means you&rsquo;re going to have to find the person who welcome you here in the first place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Bernard Zwirn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, so you have to find Bernard Zwirn and then he&rsquo;ll send you home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myrna Delacourte stacked several maps and brochures together and handed them to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Would you like a coupon book for the shopping outlets on the west side of the forest? Actually, I&rsquo;m just going to include it and that way you have it. Better have it and not need it, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, I need to go straight through the forest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, go straight through the forest and then hang a left. You&rsquo;ll see signs and follow the maps. One more thing about the forest, though. You need to be aware that the trees grow and move so you need to grow and move with them. Don&rsquo;t get caught on your heels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye, Myrna,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he walked past the booth. &ldquo;I hope you get to see your family again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye, Benjamin. If you come across any apples, make sure to let me know.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6">Chapter 20: In Which There Is A Tree</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin had been walking for the better part of the afternoon before he realized that he could not yet see an exit to the forest. It seemed to him like he might be walking in circles. Or worse, it seemed like the forest actually went on forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surrounded by trees hundreds of times taller than he, with large branches that blocked his view of the sky. Brown leaves rustled on the ground as green leaves combed the air above. If he did not need to find the exit before the sun set, he would have enjoyed the peace and calm of everything around him.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The trees were extraordinary. Benjamin stood small and insignificant compared to their size. They climbed thousands of feet into the air like wooden skyscrapers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this was fine except that he wanted to leave, soon. The forest was the first of many things on his map that he received from Myrna. After the forest, there was a waterfall. Then, there was a river. Then, there was a prairie. Then, there was a mountain range. Then, a volcano. And finally, there was another castle that had information on how to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some berries on the ground and Benjamin decided that he needed to learn whether he was walking in circles or not. He gathered the berries and started to smash them against the trunk of a tree. As he tried to do so, the tree seemed to shake back and forth in such a way that none of the berries stuck. He grabbed some more berries and tried to smash them into the tree again. And again, the tree shook from side to side and the berry juice flew back into Benjamin&rsquo;s face. Thinking that perhaps that tree had some sort of infection, he gathered more berries and tried to smash them into the trunk of another tree. And, the same thing happened. The tree shook the berries off it. He didn&rsquo;t understand what was happening but decided he would try one last time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathered as many berries as his hands could hold and ran to the tree with the widest trunk in all of the forest. He held the red fruit above his head and as hard and fast as he could, he swung his arms into the tree. The berries smashed into the trunk and then flew back into Benjamin&rsquo;s face just as fast as he had thrown them into the tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is your problem!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked around. He didn&rsquo;t know who asked that question but it sounded like a woman who was not too far away from him. It was a voice much deeper than Myrna&rsquo;s and it echoed throughout the forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take a hint!&rdquo; the voice yelled again. &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s fun to have some little creature run up to you and smash berries into your side. Don&rsquo;t you know berries stain?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know berries stain,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he moved his head back and forth to try to find the source of the voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I used them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You were throwing berries into my side on purpose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are you? Where are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some nerve. I thought you&rsquo;d get the gist if I shook them away but for some reason, you had to run back with more berries. More berries! Why would you think I would want berries in my side?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to mark the trees so that I know whether I am on the right trail or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And you think throwing berries into my side without asking my permission is the answer to your problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think it would solve my problem, yes. If I saw the berries again, I&rsquo;d know that I was walking around in circles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, the only problem is that I wouldn&rsquo;t keep the berries on my side. They stain! Why would I want them on my side?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He tried to put them on me too,&rdquo; an older deep manly voice echoed from another side of the forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He did what?!&rdquo; the woman&rsquo;s voice yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He smashed berries into my side as well,&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s voice said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, this is just a berry massacre, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;This little boy has been trying to smash berries into the side of all of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; a young girl&rsquo;s voice said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The children!&rdquo; the female&rsquo;s voice said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve even tried to smash berries into the children!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I shook at least a dozen times and there are still some berry on me,&rdquo; the elderly man said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take at least a few washings until I&rsquo;m able to get this stain out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is just an awful day,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s berry stains everywhere. Don&rsquo;t you know how difficult it is to get berry stains off!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Benjamin said honestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ask your mother,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re impossible. Downright impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; said the young girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty much an embarrassment at this point. I&rsquo;ve got berry in my trunk that&rsquo;ll take weeks to get out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Benjamin realized that he was talking to the trees but he was still moving his head back and forth because he couldn&rsquo;t understand where the voices were coming from. And so, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if the trees themselves were talking to him or if there was a group of people who were creating an elaborate joke. He didn&rsquo;t think it was an impossibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are you all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, now he wants introductions,&rdquo; the elderly man&rsquo;s voice said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Little boy comes into the forest and makes a mess of everything and now he wants to know our names,&rdquo; the female voice said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Kids these days are so rude. They&rsquo;ve got no manners and think they can throw berries wherever they want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re preaching to the choir, Earl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, his name is Earl,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly, referring to the elderly voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh shoot, I&rsquo;m sorry Earl,&rdquo; said the females voice while the young girl giggled in the background.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve done it again,&rdquo; said Earl. &ldquo;You were never good at keeping secrets, Bertha.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bertha?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So now you&rsquo;re going to make fun of my name?&rdquo; Bertha asked sarcastically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, no, I was just confirming that your name is Bertha.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Bertha. That&rsquo;s Earl. I&rsquo;m Bertha. And, that&rsquo;s Gertrude. You know all our names so now you know who to send money to for our cleaning bill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Benjamin. I&rsquo;m sorry I stained your trunks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, eh?&rdquo; said Earl. &ldquo;I would have thought you looked a bit more like a robin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Robin, yes,&rdquo; said Bertha. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen many robins before and you do look a lot like them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to find my way from the forest. I&rsquo;ve been walking around for hours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been watching you,&rdquo; Gertrude said. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been walking around longer than hours. It&rsquo;s been a couple days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Days?!&rdquo; Benjamin said in surprise. &ldquo;But, the sun hasn&rsquo;t set yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t set over this forest. It just keeps circling and circling and circling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly how I felt I was walking around. In circles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You were.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See! I would have learned this had I put berries on the trunks of trees.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You could have learned just as well if you just asked!&rdquo; said Earl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get an answer if I asked a question into a forest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Bertha said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that group in the midwest of the forest that&rsquo;s rather rude. They probably wouldn&rsquo;t have told you. You should have put berries on them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where am I now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the north east. Can&rsquo;t you tell by our sophistication?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin couldn&rsquo;t tell. They looked like any other trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, fine,&rdquo; Bertha said. &ldquo;But, you&rsquo;re going to have to believe us. We&rsquo;re very, very sophisticated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you help me leave the forest?&rdquo; Benjamin asked the towering natural wonders around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That depends on where you&rsquo;d like to go,&rdquo; Earl said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this map and it says I&rsquo;ve got to find a waterfall on the side of the forest opposite the side I entered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Bertha. &ldquo;Did you get that map from Myrna?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Earl said slowly. &ldquo;Myrna&rsquo;s maps are always outdated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Outdated? How often does a waterfall change?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well look what we have here, Earl,&rdquo; Bertha said as a tree shook back and forth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a regular &lsquo;ole expert on waterfalls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin blushed lightly. He had never heard of a waterfall that changed directions or moved or relocated. But then again, he never heard of talking trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thinking that I&rsquo;ve got this map and that&rsquo;s the only way I know how to get home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; asked Bertha.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees shook violently back and forth and then didn&rsquo;t say a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Anyways,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he sighed in frustration. &ldquo;Can you help me find the exit to the forest that&rsquo;s opposite the desert?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You came through the desert?&rdquo; Gertrude asked. &ldquo;No one survives the desert. That&rsquo;s one of the most dangerous places outside of all the castles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt a little proud of himself because he did, indeed, survive. It wasn&rsquo;t so bad, he thought. He could do it again if he needed to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you need to exit opposite the desert, you&rsquo;re going to need to head for the canyon. The canyon will take you to a river and then Myrna&rsquo;s map may be able to guide you the rest of the way,&rdquo; Earl said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Benjamin said and then paused for a moment. &ldquo;But, which way is the canyon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pointing to it,&rdquo; Earl said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked up at the nearest tree and saw a trunk soaring into the sky with hundreds of branches pointing every possible direction. He was a little embarrassed because he did not know what Earl meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I can&rsquo;t--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, Benjamin?&rdquo; Bertha asked with somewhat concern. &ldquo;Earl is pointing in the direction of the canyon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right there, Benjamin,&rdquo; Earl said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can see but it&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s so many--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Gertrude said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can see,&rdquo; Benjamin responded. &ldquo;But your branches are going in so--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Earl said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right there!&rdquo; Bertha echoed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked into the sky and decided he could only know which direction to go if he started to walk. He took three steps forward in one direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Earl yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he stopped and took three steps to his left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bertha yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he stopped and took three steps backwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, almost but!&rdquo; Earl yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Earl or Bertha could say anything more, Benjamin turned a little bit to the right and started to walk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Gertrude said. &ldquo;I guess he can see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So if I walk straight, I&rsquo;ll walk to the canyon?&rdquo; Benjamin asked the trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t able to miss it,&rdquo; Bertha said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And if you need directions in the future,&rdquo; Earl continued. &ldquo;Just ask someone. It&rsquo;s incredibly rude to smash red berries into our sides. Unless you see James. You can smash red berries in the side of James. He&rsquo;s the worst.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; Bertha said. &ldquo;James is the worst.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The worst indeed,&rdquo; Gertrude echoed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he started to walk forward. &ldquo;Thanks for your help and sorry again about your tree trunks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; said Earl. &ldquo;Get out of here you little punk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin placed one foot in front of the other and found a spot as far in the distance as he could see. He would walk as straight as he could because, he decided, he was not about to ask any more trees for help. And, understandably, he was not about to mark his path, either. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.j8vydqo66r6"></a><span>Chapter 21: In Which There Is A Request</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his own calculation, Benjamin had taken three thousand steps before he reached the edge of the forest. And as far as he could tell, these steps had been in the same direction as each other because he saw a canyon extend into the horizon. The sun was setting now that he left the forest and Benjamin decided it was as good a time as any to get some rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a tree that looked as comfortable as any to rest against and closed his eyes as the crisp warm air brushed against his clothes. They had been closed for only minutes when he heard a familiar sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;South! South!&rdquo; the squirrel yelled as it ran by. &ldquo;South! South!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched the little creature run by his side and out of sight, leaving a small dust trail in his path. With the disturbance having passed, Benjamin once again closed his eyes to relax in the sun. And just as he was settled, the voice appeared again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;North! North!&rdquo; the squirrel yelled as it ran by again. &ldquo;North! North!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin jumped to his feet and took one step toward the squirrel who ran away faster. The little woodland creature was running back and forth. Only seconds later, Benjamin saw the squirrel turn around in the distance and begin running back again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;South! South!&rdquo; the squirrel yelled in the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realizing that his nap time had passed and that this squirrel was going to run back and forth indefinitely, Benjamin positioned himself directly in the path of the animal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;South! South!&rdquo; the squirrel screamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin shifted to his left and then to his right, making sure the squirrel was going to run straight at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;South! South!&rdquo; the squirrel screamed as its eyes widened and slobber flew from its lips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only twenty feet away when Benjamin stretched his arms as wide as they could reach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;South! South!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin braced himself for a collision with a little animal weighing little more than an orange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;SOUTH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the squirrel neared, it did not slow. Benjamin crouched to the ground and lunged at the little guy. And although Benjamin thought he would quickly outmatch the tiny speed demon, it was going so fast that it hit Benjamin square in the stomach. The young boy and the adrenaline-filled squirrel rolled together over and over and over until both of them lay side by side with their arms stretched to their sides and their legs in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;South,&rdquo; the squirrel said faintly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; said Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither animal moved for a minute as they both pondered what just happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My head hurts,&rdquo; the squirrel whispered as it stood up and adjusted the goggles it had been wearing to keep dirt out of its eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You ran right into me,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he rubbed his belly. &ldquo;Your head should hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even see you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was standing right in front of you the entire time. How didn&rsquo;t you see me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I run with my eyes closed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You run with your eyes closed? How do you know where you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I yell the direction I want to go. If I want to go north, I yell north! If I want to go south, I yell south. East? East! West? West!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But yelling the direction isn&rsquo;t going to help when you run into something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running around for forty years. I&rsquo;ve learned a thing or two. First thing I learned is that yes, you do run into things. Second thing I learned is that I can run a lot faster if I run with my eyes closed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are you running to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a better question than asking about the weather,&rdquo; the squirrel said as it propped its elbow on its knee and tilted its head to the sky. It tapped the ground several times with its tail and then smacked its lips. &ldquo;I supposed you can ask where are we all running? Or, are we running? Or, are we running to something or are we running from something.&rdquo; The squirrel got to his feet and pressed its finger against its forehead. It stopped and shifted its head back quickly. &ldquo;Or, we&rsquo;re running from and to something! But what does that mean while we&rsquo;re running? I suppose that would mean we&rsquo;re always running from something and we&rsquo;re always running to something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But you were just running,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;What were </span><span class="c4">you</span><span>&nbsp;running from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bears?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, yes. The bears. They&rsquo;re awful. Will eat you alive, really. Scary things. That&rsquo;s another reason I close my eyes: bears. If I can&rsquo;t see the bears, I won&rsquo;t be scared of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You could avoid them if you saw them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel paced back and forth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right. If I saw the bears, I could avoid them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you are running away from bears?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m running away from a lot of issues,&rdquo; the squirrel said as he nudged Benjamin&rsquo;s sneaker with its elbow. &ldquo;But yes, mostly bears. And, my fear of failure but we don&rsquo;t need to talk about that. How did you get so smart?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m very smart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you certainly ask interesting questions. I&rsquo;ve been running back and forth away from bears for forty years and no one has asked me these types of questions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m curious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Curiosity is a great thing!&rdquo; the squirrel said quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever lose that. Curiosity can get you very far.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember that,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; the squirrel said as it wiped the dirt from its goggles. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually smart and curious enough to help one of my friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What kind of help does he need?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you see he collects nuts. Walnuts, to be precise. And, you see he&rsquo;s got this problem where he can&rsquo;t chew very well anymore. It&rsquo;s embarrassing and pretty gross and all. So he&rsquo;s got all these walnuts but he can&rsquo;t eat them because he can&rsquo;t get the shell open. Do you think you could help him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He needs someone to open the walnuts for him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, you see he can&rsquo;t do it himself. I don&rsquo;t know him very well but I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d pay you back.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin thought that this was going to distract him from his plan and although he wouldn&rsquo;t mind meeting another talking creature, he just couldn&rsquo;t. It would be a distraction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish I had time to help your friend, but I really must get going,&rdquo; Benjamin said to the sad squirrel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel lowered his head slowly and began twisting his left foot into the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the squirrel said slowly. &ldquo;I understand. It&rsquo;s OK, really. He can starve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to starve,&rdquo; Benjamin pleaded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not all animals have to eat, right? He should be fine eating... air.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not going to be able to eat air.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; the squirrel said as it waved its hand at Benjamin and began to take one step away. &ldquo;You go wherever you need to go. Chesterfield will just have to develop a taste for eating dirt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt bad. He knew that he could easily open walnuts and he didn&rsquo;t want this Chesterfield person to starve. He took one deep breath and wondered how much time it would take to crack a couple walnuts. If there were ten, it might take him less than ten minutes. He didn&rsquo;t know exactly but he was fine to take ten minutes to feed another animal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Where are these walnuts?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel jumped in the air and shook Benjamin&rsquo;s hand with a new energy Benjamin had not yet see in the animal. And as soon as Benjamin realized that the squirrel had not yet let got of his hand, it ran as fast as it could, pulling Benjamin along behind it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;North! North!&rdquo; the squirrel yelled as it ran faster and faster. Benjamin&rsquo;s body was bouncing up and down on the grass, creating one of the biggest grass stains ever seen. &ldquo;North! North!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrived at a large tree in the middle of a meadow, Benjamin looked behind him to see the path that his body had created by being dragged on the ground. It was exhausting and his body ached. The squirrel, however, had not lost his enthusiasm for Benjamin&rsquo;s willingness to help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel ran to the trunk and knocked loudly. Benjamin heard another creature running around inside the massive tree. It was as tall as it was wide and had thousands of branches, each branch with thousands of leaves. It stood alone in a meadow a couple miles wide in every direction with mountains lining the edges. Wind brushed through wheat that had grown to Benjamin&rsquo;s waist as lonely cloud after lonely cloud took turns blocking the sun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel knocked loudly on the tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Chesterfield!&rdquo; the squirrel said. &ldquo;I found a problem to all of our, I mean your problems! It&rsquo;s time to eat, Chesterfield!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The running inside the tree came to an abrupt stop. The squirrel took a couple steps back from the trunk and a previously invisible door opened slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you want, Barnaby?&rdquo; an unknown figure shouted from within the tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Chesterfield, I&rsquo;ve found our hero!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What did you do with your bird?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It flew away,&rdquo; Barnaby the squirrel said sadly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It flew away?&rdquo; Chesterfield asked with disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yup, it flew away,&rdquo; Barnaby said while averting his eyes to Barnaby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It was dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yup, flew away and all,&rdquo; Barnaby said as he acted out the flying of a bird with his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I gave it to you as a present.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, if you wanted me to keep it,&rdquo; Barnaby protested. &ldquo;Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t hand out presents that are dead birds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have much time. Can you give me whatever walnuts you have to open?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the tree trunk opened completely, a three foot by three foot door within the frame of a tree ten times that width. And standing within this relatively large door was a relatively small chipmunk named Chesterfield. He stood not four inches tall with one of the worst smiles Benjamin had seen on any living thing. If apples were smiles, Chesterfield&rsquo;s smile was a rotten apple smashed under truck and then scooped up with a shovel. It was difficult for Benjamin to look directly in his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Chesterfield exclaimed with his arms stretched to his sides. &ldquo;Barnaby, you should have told me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I did tell you. This child is going to be our hero.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me get the walnuts!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chesterfield slammed the door closed and ran throughout the tree, shaking a branch and some leaves here and there. Benjamin heard the sounds of musical instruments, construction, and loud engines throughout the tree as Chesterfield moved about. It was the biggest house for a chipmunk Benjamin had ever seen. When the door swung open again minutes later, Chesterfield appeared with five walnuts in his mouth and hands. He scooted across the grass and placed them at Benjamin&rsquo;s feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin couldn&rsquo;t believe his luck. There were only five walnuts. This would take him no time at all. He would help a starving chipmunk and be on his way in a matter of minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the walnuts and examined each to see that they were ordinary walnuts that he had seen in his mother&rsquo;s kitchen many times. He knew how to open these shells because he had seen his parents open them many times before. All he had to do was find something hard to slam them against. And having learned his lesson in the forest, he wasn&rsquo;t about to slam the walnuts into the side of the tree. He strolled around the meadow and searched for a large rock, something the size of his head that would be sturdy enough with a flat surface to absorb a walnut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed a rock between Barnaby and Chesterfield as they watched Benjamin&rsquo;s every move with increasing interest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chesterfield put his hand against the rock. It looked like a man standing next to a huge boulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you know how long it took us to move that rock from here to where you just picked it up?&rdquo; Chesterfield said with annoyance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it back!&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chesterfield and Barnaby stood to the side. Benjamin picked up a walnut and slammed it against the rock, creating a quick cracking noise with a sudden burst of shell in the air. The squirrel and chipmunk covered their heads as it began to rain shell fragments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin picked up the second. Crack!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third. Crack!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth. Crack!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the fifth. Crack!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had opened all of the walnuts in less than five minutes. And, he felt really happy that he had done something that he had only seen his parents do. Now he knew he could do it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiny little jaws of Chesterfield and Barnaby nearly touched the ground. They shook their heads and then applauded as an audience would applaud a golfer&rsquo;s drive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That was,&rdquo; Chesterfield said, taking a slow step forward, &ldquo;extremely impressive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Benjamin said, happy to receive the compliment. &ldquo;And, now you can eat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Barnaby said, taking a quick step forward. &ldquo;Now, he can eat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, I should get going but I&rsquo;m glad I was able to help you,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Enjoy the walnuts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin grabbed his backpack and examined the long grass stain along his shirt. It would probably come out in the wash, he thought. They always did. As he started to walk away, Barnaby ran in front of Benjamin and put his hands out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Barnaby said. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t realize you would be so good at opening walnuts. Five walnuts is great. Don&rsquo;t get us wrong. We are very grateful for your help. But if we had a few more walnuts open, then Chesterfield could eat all month without having to find someone else to open them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Barnaby, I must be going. Why don&rsquo;t you try opening the walnuts?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barnaby held his fingers forward and Benjamin saw that they had all been worn out, presumably from opening many walnuts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How many more walnuts?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. He couldn&rsquo;t stay long but he could open a couple more. And, it was a lot of fun smashed walnuts into a rock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not many. As many as you want to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, bring out the walnuts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin returned to the rock and waited for Barnaby to stop whispering to Chesterfield so that he could begin opening the nuts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;Would you mind coming inside my treehouse to open the rest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Inside the treehouse? Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I thought I could offer you a spot of tea and some biscuits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin only thought briefly about what biscuits and tea a chipmunk was capable of making.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was also curious to see the inside of the tree. After he watched Chesterfield walk inside, he stuck his own head in to look inside. The space was as high as the tree and along the cylindrical room was a spiral staircase that spun around shelves and shelves of walnuts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on in!&rdquo; Barnaby said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, come in,&rdquo; Chesterfield said as he pulled out some biscuits and tea. Barnaby and Chesterfield looked at the size of the biscuits and then compared them to the size of Benjamin. They were not nearly as large as they should be to satisfy the child&rsquo;s appetite. &ldquo;Come in! Come in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin squeezed through the tiny door until he was completely inside the tree. Barnaby shut the door and Chesterfield handed Benjamin biscuit after biscuit. As Benjamin ate the delicious treats, he began to wonder why there were so many walnuts on the shelves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you really like walnuts?&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if like is the right word, but we&rsquo;ve gotten used to them,&rdquo; Chesterfield said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It looks like there are hundreds here,&rdquo; Benjamin replied as he sipped tea and ate another biscuit. He had eaten nearly a dozen so far while Barnaby was halfway through his first biscuit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Chesterfield said as he tapped his fingers together. &ldquo;There are actually a few more than that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A few more?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not many more. Just a few. We were hoping you could help us open a few. You opened the five walnuts so quickly that it will take you such a short amount of time than it would take us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How many is a few?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with caution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barnaby and Chesterfield started to ascend the staircase backwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he noticed the chipmunk and squirrel walking up the staircase. &ldquo;How many is a few?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kept walking faster and faster and faster until they were out of Benjamin&rsquo;s reach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Forty-two million,&rdquo; Barnaby said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Forty-two million walnuts!&rdquo; Benjamin explained as he stood on his feet. &ldquo;I am not going to open forty-two million walnuts!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take you such a short amount of time compared to how long it will take us!&rdquo; Barnaby protested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m not concerned with how long it would take you. It&rsquo;s going to take me longer than I offered you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But we gave you biscuits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open a dozen and then that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Benjamin decided. He grabbed twelve walnuts from the shelf and then smashed them individually on the stone inside the tree. Twelve open walnuts appeared on the ground below and as before, Chesterfield and Barnaby stood on the staircase and golf clapped. &ldquo;Now, I must be leaving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin gathered his backpack and went to open the door from which he entered. But, it was locked. He pushed on it as hard as he could but it would not open. There wasn&rsquo;t anything that would allow him to unlock the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled up the tree house. &ldquo;The door is locked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I would like you to open it for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because we have a lot of walnuts that need to be opened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You open this door right now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you open all of the walnuts, we will open it immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was irate. He shook the door violently which caused the tree to vibrate ever so slightly. Walnuts fell from the tallest of shelves. He grumbled and his voiced echoed throughout the tree. Barnaby and Chesterfield climbed higher and higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Once you open all the walnuts,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;We will unlock the door.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would take days, weeks, months, and maybe a year to open forty-two million walnuts. There was no chance he could do this within a reasonable amount of time. But Benjamin realized something else which was much more important to him. He had been tricked. He assumed he would only have to open a few more walnuts, not millions. And now that he was locked inside the tree trunk, he was being held prisoner by a chipmunk and a squirrel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided not to open a single walnut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not opening any!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, fine,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t any, then you&rsquo;ll probably starve unless you can eat air. You&rsquo;re going to have to open a few to satisfy yourself. Those biscuits will only last so long. If you need us, we&rsquo;ll be in the loft.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barnaby and Chesterfield ran all the way up the staircase to the top of the tree to a loft that was away from Benjamin&rsquo;s sight. The staircase was too narrow and thin to support Benjamin&rsquo;s weight. It would break on the first step.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin needed to figure out how to leave. He couldn&rsquo;t open the door and he wasn&rsquo;t going to open all the walnuts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paced back and forth at the bottom of the tree trunk thinking about all the ways that one might be able to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could dig a tunnel. But, he did not have a shovel and the trunk was too tough for his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could punch a hole in the tree trunk. But, the tree trunk was more than a foot thick and he didn&rsquo;t have anything that strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could explode the entire tree with dynamite. But, he didn&rsquo;t have any dynamite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he settled upon a solution that was the least easy but the most promising. He would scale the inside of the tree like a rock climber scaling the side of a mountain. At the top, he would grab Barnaby and Chesterfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin put his backpack on and found the wall that he would like to scale. He had never climbed any wall or shelf and this one, unfortunately, was very, very high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed with frustration at being trapped in the tree. And as soon as he took a breath, he began his climb. Hand over hand and foot over foot he climbed and climbed. Walnuts feel everywhere as he shook the shelves and moved his feet and hands in different spots. It was difficult but Benjamin was beginning to get comfortable with what he was doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was comfortable until he looked down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was twenty feet above the ground and realized that he had nothing to stop him from falling on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it was too late. He was nearly halfway to the top of the tree and he needed to continue. With each climb, he knocked walnuts to the ground. His left foot slipped off as he tried to find a sturdy location to place it, causing him to hold on as tightly as he could with just his hands. The walnuts falling to the ground sounded like a pitter patter of rain against wood. Benjamin regained his composure by finding a resting spot for his left leg. He kept looking above so that he knew where he was going to step next.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Eventually, he made it to the top. And at the top, he saw a loft with a squirrel and a chipmunk asleep in front of a massive television screen. They had been watching some Spanish soap opera show together. Benjamin couldn&rsquo;t believe that they were sleeping while forcing him to do all that work.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He squeezed into the loft and then slowly nudged his way behind them. When he decided that he was close enough and that they were still sleeping, he grabbed both of them at the same time.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What! Woah! No!&rdquo; Barnaby yelled.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this! Stop it!&rdquo; Chesterfield screamed.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That was not very nice!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled at Barnaby and Chesterfield outside the tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry! We&rsquo;re sorry!&rdquo; Barnaby said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re terribly sorry!&rdquo; Chesterfield said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let us go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can go! We&rsquo;ll set you free!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, unexpectedly, both of them burst into tears. The noises they made while crying were embarrassing. They cried and bawled and shook and screamed while Benjamin sat with Barnaby in his left hand and Chesterfield in his right. It was an uncomfortable situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We know we&rsquo;re awful!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So sorry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Take all the walnuts you want. Have them all,&rdquo; Barnaby said in tears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, you can have them all. Whatever you want. We&rsquo;re really sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any walnuts. I just want to leave,&rdquo; Benjamin said without letting go of either animal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, fine, we&rsquo;ll let you go. Don&rsquo;t kill us! Please don&rsquo;t kill us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to kill you!&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo; Barnaby asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, why would you think I&rsquo;m going to kill you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s what Aloysius promises to do whenever he grabs us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aloysius Trenhaile?&rdquo; Benjamin asked with curiosity. &ldquo;How do you know him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Little boy,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;Why do you think we have forty-two million walnuts?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t starve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not exactly it,&rdquo; said Barnaby. &ldquo;I may have lied a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You both lied a lot!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Barnaby said. &ldquo;We lied a lot. We send walnuts to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle for food.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You send him food? Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So that he doesn&rsquo;t kill us,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;We put all of the cracked walnuts in that basket on the branch over there.&rdquo; Chesterfield pointed to a basket on the opposite wall from the loft. &ldquo;Every week, a bird comes and picks it up to take it to Aloysius Trenhaile. And in exchange, we get to live another week.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a great way to live.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Barnaby said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve been trying to find someone else to open up all these walnuts. So, we don&rsquo;t have to!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make what you did to me right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We know!&rdquo; Barnaby and Chesterfield yelled together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the second time, they cried and bawled and shook and screamed as Benjamin&rsquo;s grip on the both of them remained tight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at all of the walnuts and then looked at the basket. That basket was headed for Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle and that was where Benjamin was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When does the bird come next?&rdquo; Benjamin asked the two of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;That basket is ready to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hide underneath the walnuts in that basket and have that bird take me to that castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You could do that if you want, or we could just open the door for you to leave,&rdquo; Barnaby offered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to go to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s Castle and that bird will be able to take me there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;We can hide you in the basket.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;After the end of the movie?&rdquo; Barnaby asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he tightened his grip on the two animals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin sat with a fist clenched around a chipmunk and a squirrel until the Spanish romance had concluded. Then, he slipped across to the other side of the tree and tunnelled his way through the walnuts to get to the bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really sorry again,&rdquo; Chesterfield said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, but don&rsquo;t do it to anyone else,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Barnaby said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And, I&rsquo;m sorry you have to work for Aloysius,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I hear bad things about him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Be very careful,&rdquo; Chesterfield said. &ldquo;Aloysius Trenhaile is the most dangerous creature alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chesterfield and Barnaby then covered the basket with a blanket as Benjamin waited for the bird to arrive.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6">Chapter 22: In Which There Is A Bird</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin waited five minutes at the bottom of the basket before he felt it jostle back and forth. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was Chesterfield and Barnaby so he started to push walnut after walnut away from his face. He did not want to startle whatever was making such loud thumping noises so he carefully peeled away a corner of the blanket that covered the basket. On the other side, Benjamin saw the ugliest, biggest, most vile goose he had ever seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the goose could see him, Benjamin threw back the blanket and covered himself with walnuts again. The bird was nearly ten times larger than Benjamin, which explained why the basket was so large. It was also ten times more disgusting. It smelled like sewage and it kept burping all over the basket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This animal was far from graceful. And if its hygiene was related to its flying abilities, Benjamin feared for his safety. He wondered if this was a good idea. Surely, this was only one way to get to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle. This didn&rsquo;t have to be the way. He could go by land. It would certainly be safer than by air with this awful beast. It didn&rsquo;t even have all of its feathers. And, some of the feathers that did remain were painted odd colors like orange and blue. They were certainly not feathers one would find on a goose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin wanted to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved the walnuts from his face and began to make his escape. The goose kept nudging the basket back and forth while making a loud chirping noise that ended in loud coughing. It had some sort of respiratory problem. As Benjamin peeled back the blanket, he started to climb from the basket while the goose looked the other direction. He pulled his weight as quickly as he could and lifted one leg over the basket. And as soon as he was about to lift the other leg over the basket, the goose began to flap its wings as strongly as it could. It created a vortex of stinky, awful wind that pushed Benjamin right back into the basket. The wind swirled around as a tornado would. Dust and dirt and awful smells blew about. Benjamin used all of his strength to get back to his feet and to step into the gusts pushing him back. He reached the ledge of the basket. And as soon as he jumped in the air to clear the basket and return to the ground, the goose grabbed the handle and lifted the basket into the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went higher and Benjamin could see the top of the treehouse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went even higher and Benjamin could see the expansive meadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went even higher still and Benjamin could see all the mountains that surrounded the meadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it went so high that Benjamin could see the large forest from which he came, he knew he had no choice but to sit and enjoy the ride. Leaving the basket now would certainly mean death. He would have to endure the flight, as smelly and stinky as it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin had never been this high above the ground in his life. He watched with amazement as a river carved its way between rolling green hills into a mountain range capped with white tops. A volcano in the distanced puffed smoke into the air next to a lake which glistened under the beaming sun. He could see meadows stretch for distances he could not imagine walking and canyons that he could not imagine traversing. The land extended in all directions and it became apparent that this land was not small.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, was it empty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin could see Castle Ehtahl, from which he recently left. And in the opposite direction, he could see nearly a dozen other castles of various shapes and designs. The only characteristic that they appeared to have in common was that all of the castles had very high walls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One castle in the far distance had very low walls. Unlike all of the others, however, it had fire on the ground as well as fire throughout the buildings. There was dark, black smoke billowing throughout and an occasional ball of flame shot into the air. It looked uninviting and deeply disturbing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, that was exactly where this ugly goose was headed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin knew it must be the castle because it alone looked like a nightmare. It was the worst, most awful place Benjamin had ever seen or imagined in his life. It was both scary and terrifying. And, Benjamin did not want to go there. He looked to the ground and guessed that he was several thousand feet above the ground. The chances of him landing safely or alive were slim. He needed to get this goose to fly lower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without creating too much of a plan, Benjamin grabbed a walnut and threw it at the goose. The filthy bird screamed in annoyance and shook the basket from side to side. This was not what Benjamin wanted. He needed another plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Benjamin thought hard, the goose shook the basket from side to side again. And then, it did it again. With each subsequent shaking, the goose moved the basket more and more violently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked ahead and noticed that objects were being fired passed the goose at an amazing speeds. One flew by and then another. And then, another. He looked in the direction from which they were coming and was able to see a group of people in a meadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were trying to shoot down the goose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird swung its wings left and nearly escaped getting hit. Then, it banked to the right and avoided several more shots being fired directly at it. Benjamin held onto the basket as tightly as he could, fearful that either the goose was going to drop him or that the bird would be hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goose jerked to the right suddenly and several walnuts flew from the basket to the ground below. Benjamin gripped the side as tightly as he could. The goose began to spiral to avoid the shots being fired at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, it was hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something hit the goose square in the head. The bird, the basket, and the boy were in freefall headed straight for land. Feathers flew everywhere and the goose screamed in panic. Benjamin screamed too. He was crashing into the earth and this was not an enjoyable adventure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air moved so fast that Benjamin could not tell how close he was to land. And since there was no sign of slowing down, he decided the best thing for him to do was close his eyes. He did not want to see what was going to happen next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He braced for impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goose braced for impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the basket splintered into a thousand pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin bounced into the air with a thousand walnuts around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he landed, he skidded along a dirt path and fell neatly along a feathery pillow. The feathery pillow was, of course, the goose which broke Benjamin&rsquo;s fall. After a few seconds, it knocked Benjamin away and investigated the mess of the situation. The basket was destroyed and walnuts were everywhere. And to the birds&rsquo; surprise, it had been hauling a person along too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stretched its broken feathers as wide as it could and screeched at Benjamin as loudly as it could. Benjamin, however, was dazed from the fall and simply sat while the bird yelled and screamed at him. He could have cared less. He did not know how he survived such a landing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he could react to the goose, the bird gathered some walnuts in its mouth and fled. It flew above the canyon nearby and eventually, beyond Benjamin&rsquo;s sight. Benjamin hoped to never see that animal again. Or, at the very least, to never smell it again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin would have continued to sit in a daze for a little longer but he heard footsteps and yelling from the other side of the hill that he had landed upon. He ran for his backpack, grabbed it, and then hid behind a boulder five times his size.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps were louder and closer. Benjamin didn&rsquo;t know how many people were running toward him but he guessed it was a dozen. He stayed as still as he could with his back to the boulder. And then, he saw a shadow cast beyond him. And then, another. And, another. There were more than a dozen people together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d it go?&rdquo; said a voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Must&rsquo;ve flown away,&rdquo; said another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It dropped the basket,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;So, I guess we&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s take the basket and get back to camp,&rdquo; said the first voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin couldn&rsquo;t see the people but he heard them gather the basket and pick up the walnuts. The shadows moved quickly and Benjamin&rsquo;s curiosity grew. He leaned against the boulder and slowly started to move to its edge. He peeked around the side and saw lots of people dressed completely in blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among all the people dressed in blue, one stopped moving and stared straight at Benjamin. Benjamin froze. Dozens of people in blue moved frantically around the one person who stayed completely still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin ran.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran as fast as he could through cacti and rocks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he ran, he heard footsteps chasing after him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He weaved every which way he could and heard the footsteps fading in the distance. He paused for a moment to look behind. There were only rocks and cacti everywhere. He sat down to catch his breath, his heart still racing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t know who those people were or why they were after the basket. There was a hill not too far away and Benjamin thought about climbing it in order to see if he could watch the people. He wondered where they were going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he continued to catch his breathe, he felt two hands on his back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move a muscle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin didn&rsquo;t move. He didn&rsquo;t have a plan to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move and do exactly as I say,&rdquo; the voice continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK. OK,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you shoot down the goose?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep, I&rsquo;m the one that hit it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin recognized the voice and spun around to see Selma Applebaum standing before him. She wore a small blue outfit and had her arms crossed over her body. Her head shook side to side as she wore an expression of disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And, we didn&rsquo;t know you would be inside the basket,&rdquo; Selma Applebaum said. &ldquo;What, Benjamin Buckingham, were you doing inside it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked angry and Benjamin was worried she still had whatever it was that knocked down the huge bird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to leave,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re obviously not doing very well,&rdquo; Selma said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, of course not. I&rsquo;m still here aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You were going to leave by goose?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was just along for the ride. It was going to take me to where I could get a key to leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have any idea where you were headed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I told you. I was going to get the key so that I could leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so confused by you, Benjamin. How do you know where the key is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he rushed to grab his backpack. He unfolded his dirty map and showed it to Selma. &ldquo;Here. I got this map that shows me where it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma examined the map and scratched her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a very good map,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So where were you trying to go? That goose was headed for an awful place. Were you trying to go there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I was headed to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle. That&rsquo;s where the goose was headed,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma looked confused and Benjamin wasn&rsquo;t sure why she was becoming more frustrated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; Selma said as she rushed him behind a boulder a little further away. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to realize I left so I have to return soon. Listen, you can&rsquo;t go to Aloysius Trenaile&rsquo;s castle by way of a goose. If you arrive in a basket full of walnuts, you&rsquo;ll be killed. You&rsquo;re lucky I was able to shoot down that bird. I saved your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And, you also almost killed me in the process!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The way I look at it is that you were doomed either way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing out here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I snuck out. I wanted to help destroy the nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Destroy the nightmares? How does shooting a goose destroy nightmares?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, I&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;re still alive,&rdquo; Selma said as she strained her neck to see if the others were still around. &ldquo;The birds deliver food to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle. We shoot down the birds to stop the food deliveries. Without food, they starve and can&rsquo;t make nightmares. If you go to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle by bird, you&rsquo;re going to get shot down again. At least, that&rsquo;s our goal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Then, how do I get to the castle? I need King Bernard Zwirn to give me his key.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Selma paused as they listened to the footsteps of the others beginning to leave. She grabbed Benjamin by the shoulders and stared straight into his face.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Meet me tomorrow outside Castle Ehtsetra,&rdquo; she said quickly.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span>Selma grabbed Benjamin&rsquo;s map and scribbled a path through it.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here right now on the map and this is where I&rsquo;ll meet you. See you tomorrow,&rdquo; she said as she sprinted back to her group.</span></p><p class="c5 c0"><span>&ldquo;But why--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Tomorrow!&rdquo; Selma yelled.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.pejv9gn0jyv"></a><span>Chapter 23: In Which There Is A Glass Castle</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin waited at the front of the gate for Selma to appear. He spent the night traversing a river, climbing the side of a cliff, hiking through fields of tangled weeds, and sleeping in a cave. He was bruised and cut and very, very sleepy. And as he waited, he wondered how long he could continue like this. It appeared to him that his exit was further and further away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; Selma asked as she approached Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean? I&rsquo;ve been living outside for the past few days. This is what you get after you&rsquo;ve been living outside for a while,&rdquo; Benjamin responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You should at least have taken a shower?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Benjamin held his arms out to present the wild environment around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where is your map?&rdquo; Selma asked. &ldquo;There are public restrooms everywhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In my backpack,&rdquo; Benjamin&rsquo;s jaw hung low. He had no idea there might be public restrooms here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Benjamin had a chance to retrieve the map for Selma, she snatched the backpack away and rummaged through it. She took out a small notebook, which she thought contained the map. But when she looked at the cover, she realized it was something completely different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Selma asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he took the backpack and extracted the map. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, this is much more interesting. Is this a book of your dreams?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing. Take the map.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma scurried away with the notebook as Benjamin chased quickly after her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Selma said as she paged through it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a list of your nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma stopped suddenly and turned to face Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a book of your dreams,&rdquo; she said with surprise. &ldquo;This is a book of nightmares. This book is full of nightmares. Why have you had so many nightmares?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stopped and took the book away from Selma. He shoved it into his backpack and walked away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t leave so quickly,&rdquo; Selma said as she chased after him. &ldquo;Why do you have so many nightmares? There are more nightmares in that book than I knew existed. I mean I knew there was a nightmare problem but you&rsquo;ve got a really bad nightmare problem. Why do you have so many?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Wouldn&rsquo;t you know better than I would?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think I would. I&rsquo;ve always been told that nightmares target people who are susceptible to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It means there&rsquo;s something in your life that makes you likely to have nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking you.

She followed him at a speedy trot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do have friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rodney Cohen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, Snark.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have any friends your own age?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who needs friends?

Maybe it&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well then I won&rsquo;t ever have friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;Unless, you make friends with people who like you for who you are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been talking about this for too long. I want to go in the castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma shrugged her shoulders and let out a loud sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma and Benjamin approached a large glass drawbridge that was much thicker and taller than the one at Castle Ehtahl. The drawbridge connected the castle over a moat filled with chipped red stone that followed the walls wherever they went. The walls, too, were a blue glass that offered a slight view into what was hidden behind. And everything behind was made of glass as well, glass of varying colors. A figure moved back and forth on the other side of the drawbridge, pacing like a guard would but moving quickly like someone in a panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Benjamin&rsquo;s side of the moat, he saw a large blue button that he assumed might be a doorbell. He moved his hand to press it because that&rsquo;s what he does whenever he sees a button. But then, Selma grabbed his hand and gave him an unsatisfied look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a certain way that you push the doorbell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Each different way you push the doorbell tells the guard on the other side where you come from. And if you don&rsquo;t push the doorbell in any kind of recognizable way, he&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;re a nightmare or some other evil thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How do you push the doorbell?&rdquo; Benjamin asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, we are going to act as delivery people,&rdquo; Selma said as she pointed to the boxes that she brought with her. &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;ll be tap, tap, long, tap, long, tap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So these are secret passwords?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Selma said as she approached the doorbell. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the evil can&rsquo;t be bothered to slow down and think about anything for a little bit. They know the patterns. Evil is just always in a hurry for whatever reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched Selma tap the button, tap it again, press it for a long time, and then tap, long, and tap. The guard slightly visible through the glass stopped marching back and forth and appeared to put his hands on the glass drawbridge to try to see who was on the other side. A muffled sound appeared from around the blue button that seemed unintelligible at first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; said a man, presumably the guard from the other side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without pausing for a moment, Selma answered the voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Delivery!&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Delivery? There are no deliveries on Saturdays.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special delivery.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you delivering?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delivering boxes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have plenty of boxes, thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Boxes filled with travel brochures.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Travel brochures? But, why would anyone want to leave Castle Ehtsetra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They were requested to be printed by the local travel agency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And they asked for a Saturday delivery? This is quite peculiar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a few days late. It should have been Thursday but we had to print a few more copies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How many copies do you have?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thousands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thousands! Thousands of people want to travel?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, but thousands of people are interested in travelling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have fiction books to satisfy those only interested in travelling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But these brochures are going to help inspire the writers of those books.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried writing a book once and and it&rsquo;s an awful affair. Really, it&rsquo;s a lonely struggle. I don&rsquo;t know how one does it. If your brochures are going to help more books be written, I suppose that&rsquo;s a good thing. Take a few steps back and I&rsquo;ll lower the drawbridge. It&rsquo;s made of glass so be mindful of any sharp edges.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drawbridge jolted forward and then slowly began leaning forward as smoothly and gracefully as a massive sheet of glass could move. It glimmered in the sun and reflected different colors of blue in all directions. When the glass bridge finally stopped, Benjamin had his first glance behind the castle walls. And everything that he saw was made of glass. There were glass roads and glass trees and glass chairs and glass cars. There were glass trains and glass skyscrapers and glass clothing worn by otherwise normal looking people. It was nearly ten times as populous as Castle Ehtahl and everyone wore sunglasses, because among all of the glass were reflecting the sun. One skyscraper in particular appeared to soar so high into the blue sky so as to touch the sun in the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed,&rdquo; Selma said as she watched Benjamin&rsquo;s eyes look higher and higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they walked across the bridge, the guard greeted them on the other side. He was nearly four times taller than he was wide, a peculiar difference from the guards at Castle Ehtahl. His white clothing took on different colors as he moved among the different colors of glass. Unlike Castle Ehtahl, he seemed quite professional and quite capable of being a guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much smaller than I expected you to be,&rdquo; the guard said to Selma and Benjamin as they stood inside the castle walls. &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re eight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Eight! Our eight year olds are nearly twice the size of you. Where are you from? Castle Eehjee? Castle Ayee? Castle Ihbihd? Castle Ahem? Castle Peehem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin didn&rsquo;t realize there were so many castles to come from. He thought it was like the number of cities to come from at home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Castle Ehtahl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, that was my next guess! That makes sense. You&rsquo;re a bit shorter over there. Anyways, do you know where the travel agency is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Selma said quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made lots of deliveries before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It really troubles me that so many people in the castle would be wanting to travel. We have everything we need in Castle Ehtsetra. Why would anyone want to leave?&rdquo; the guard responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;Maybe they want to see what exists somewhere else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bunch of rubbish in my mind. If they want to see what exists somewhere else, they should just read books.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, maybe they could read books and travel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I like that. I think people should stay put. They should either be on one side of the wall or on the other side of the wall. I&rsquo;ve been a guard for fifty years and let me tell you, it&rsquo;s very hard to sit on a wall.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re going to go,&rdquo; Selma said as she started walking forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; the guard said. &ldquo;But, don&rsquo;t stay too long. You&rsquo;re allowed to stay overnight but then you have to leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right, we&rsquo;re not going to be long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma and Benjamin walked among the hundreds of people moving to and fro in the middle of the glass city. They all had expressionless faces, their eyes hidden by dark sunglasses. Many people carried glass briefcases and just about everyone was wearing white clothing except for the occasional person who wore a blue color as blue as the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you really come here often?&rdquo; Benjamin asked Selma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quickly as she scanned the scene. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been here once before when I was little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, how do you know where we&rsquo;re supposed to go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good memory,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nothing much changes in Castle Ehtsetra. The glass doesn&rsquo;t break as often as you&rsquo;d think it would. We have to go up there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma pointed to the top of the tall skyscraper Benjamin saw on the outside. It reached so far into the sky that it looked as if it might at one point leave the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is up there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we find a way to get you back to your home, without having to go to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked to an elevated tram station and joined the lines of people waiting for the next train. When it arrived, it was made of nothing but bright green glass that slid across an orange railway. They rode the train for a half an hour, moving throughout the city and stopping at various elevated train stations along the way. The glass structures allowed Benjamin to see into buildings in a way he could not have imagined when the walls were made of steel or brick. It allowed him to see people on different levels, interacting with their surroundings as if they were walking on air. The various colors of glass created different colors when seen through each other. And for all of the transparency throughout the buildings and structures and benches and greenery, the people were as quiet and still as possible. No one uttered a word to anyone else and no one seemed capable of a smile. They all looked like cloned models of each other, walking around a pristine glass environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How--&rdquo; Benjamin began to ask but stopped. As soon as he opened his mouth, he saw every face in the train turn in his direction. He did not utter a word further but his first word continued to echo over and over. Selma looked at him and put her finger to her lips.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin and Selma exited at the station that led them to the skyscraper at the center of the town. They encountered hundreds of other people before entering the building. Once inside, Benjamin felt more comfortable speaking.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;No one says anything here,&rdquo; he said to Selma. &ldquo;How do people communicate if they cannot speak to one another?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Did you hear that echo when you said one word?&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;Imagine if everyone were to talk at once. Our ears would explode with the noise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;So no one talks?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;They do. I&rsquo;ve seen them. But, they&rsquo;re very careful with what they say because sounds bounce off the glass loudly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Seems like a difficult way to live,&rdquo; Benjamin whispered to Selma as they walked to the front desk.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Or it&rsquo;s as difficult as living in a place where everyone can say whatever they want but no one hears it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the same thing,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he looked upwards and wondered how many floors he could see through from the ground.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>At the front desk, a woman wearing white with large, bushy red hair moved her head from side to side in a jerky motion. Benjamin wondered how she did not hurt her neck because he knew he could not do so without hurting himself.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Hello, may I help you?&rdquo; the lady asked with a gentle, bouncy tone.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Selma responded. &ldquo;What floor is the travel agency on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>As she asked for the travel agency, everyone on the floor around them stopped and looked in her direction. The lady at the front desk stopped moving her head from side to side and stared at Selma with a surprised expression. Benjamin could hear his heartbeat among the silence of everything around him.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; the lady asked as she signaled to everyone else in the lobby to carry along. &ldquo;Why do you want to go to the travel agency?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I have these boxes to deliver,&rdquo; Selma said as she pointed to the boxes that Benjamin was carrying.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the lady responded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! I thought for a second that you wanted to leave!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady laughed with a sound Benjamin thought was much louder than the woman was capable of making. She heaved her head back and forth as she pounded her fist into the table. Others in the lobby began to laugh and Benjamin heard what it was for everyone in a glass room to make a loud noise at once. It was both deafening and painful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please! You must deliver those boxes at once. After all, they are not made of glass. It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing to have boxes made of cardboard. We have some of the finest boxes ever created and they are made of glass. When you deliver the boxes, please make sure the containers are disposed of. We cannot have those here. They must be destroyed. And if you children would like to change into white clothing, that could be arranged as--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only delivering the boxes and then we plan to leave,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; the lady answered. &ldquo;I suppose you had better be on your way. It&rsquo;s floor two thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight on your right. And again, do not leave those boxes anywhere. They&rsquo;re quite out of place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt out of place. He did not know how people could live in an environment that had such strict rules around noise and materials. At home, no one cared what materials made a box. A box was a box. But here, everything had to be glass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they stepped into the glass elevator, Benjamin noticed that the two-thousand seven-hundred and eighty-eighth floor was the highest floor. With the thousands of buttons on the wall indicating each floor, Benjamin was glad this one was so easy to locate. They were alone in a tiny glass room being flung to the top of the skyscraper at a speed faster than Benjamin had experienced. And as they soared higher and higher, Benjamin&rsquo;s fear of heights became more and more real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To distract himself, he turned to Selma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do people do here?&rdquo; he asked her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean? They live,&rdquo; she responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I mean they make dreams in Castle Ehtahl. What do they make here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said with an understanding look. &ldquo;Daydreams.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.m50fh6auuhv9"></a><span>Chapter 24: In Which There Is A Glass Tower</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were nearly three hundred floors in the air when Benjamin&rsquo;s curiosity for searching for the dream studios caught the best of him. He looked down. And upon looking down, he wished he hadn&rsquo;t done so because his fear of heights became even more real. It was one thing to stand on the roof of his building in New York. It was another thing to be soaring into the air in a glass container, approaching clouds at a blistering fast speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you been on this elevator before?&rdquo; he asked Selma nervously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, why?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wondering if it ever breaks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Breaks?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, like does it ever get stuck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Selma responded as she looked around the glass cube. &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Benjamin said while taking a deep breath. &ldquo;That makes me feel a lot better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It probably crashes to the ground first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Into thousands of pieces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have to worry--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, tell me the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you could survive a fall from up here,&rdquo; Selma said with a chuckle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t making me feel good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There probably hasn&rsquo;t been an accident on this elevator all week.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All week? What about last week?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tons of accidents!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Selma said as she stopped laughing. &ldquo;Just think of something happy. You are in a castle that makes daydreams by the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin closed his eyes and tried to imagine he was not thousands of feet in the air. He thought about what he would be doing if he were at home at that very moment. Walking home from school, he thought. It was a sunny day and the roads were covered with cars and taxis in New York. A bus a few blocks away picked up some pedestrians while a fire truck passed in the opposite direction. A few birds flew overhead, moving from tree to tree in search of some shade to cool from the heat. A bakery on the other side of the street had an unusually long line for an afternoon while its next door Nordic restaurant was unusually empty. As Benjamin walked further and further, he noticed the people on the street were not talking to one another. No one was talking in the bakery or the restaurant or on the bus for that matter. They were all wearing sunglasses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; Selma yelled as she grabbed Benjamin&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin opened his eyes and thought he heard thunder and saw lightning in the distance. Selma looked like she had been trying to wake him for a while. She let out a loud sigh and then released his shoulder abruptly before moving to the other side of the elevator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was daydreaming,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to figure out how to stop the nightmares,&rdquo; she said without looking at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any control of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You do, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been told. You&rsquo;ve got to figure out how to make the nightmares stop. Or else, bad things will happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What kind of bad things?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Things worse than falling thousands of feet down an elevator shaft.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s pretty terrible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. This will be worse. When there are more nightmares, there are fewer dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator stopped and Benjamin felt his stomach touch his shoulders. A bell chimed loudly and the doors slowly parted to reveal a small hallway on the two-thousand seven-hundred and eighty-eighth floor. Benjamin and Selma stepped from the elevator into a room shaped like a glass ball that felt like a snow globe. He could see nothing but blue skies, clouds, and the sun. There were no birds flying around at this height. Benjamin and Selma were the only living things around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for a man wearing a bright white suit standing at attention in front of the only door in the room. He held a gold cane and wore a white top hat slightly tilted to the side. Benjamin thought the man looked more like a cartoon character than a real person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;May I help you?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Selma said as she stepped forward. &ldquo;My friend and I would like to speak with the travel agent. We&rsquo;d like to go on a trip.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m terribly sorry but the travel agent isn&rsquo;t here right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Selma said with disappointment. &ldquo;When will she return?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When she feels like it I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you know what time that would be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;About ten minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can we wait until she arrives?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m generally not allowed to let people wait. You could come back tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t come back tomorrow because we have to leave today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That is quite a predicament. I suppose you could stay on one condition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the condition?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man twisted his cane around his hand and pointed to a lightbulb at the top of the glass spherical roof. Benjamin and Selma looked in the direction to which he was pointing. And upon seeing what the man was pointing to, Benjamin felt his stomach turn in disapproval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a piece of dust on the outside of the glass. I have a harness and everything but I&rsquo;ve just not had the time to clean it. It&rsquo;s so busy here,&rdquo; said the man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked around and imagined that no one had been to this floor in quite some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you can remove that bit of dust, I suppose you can stay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, he&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Selma said before asking Benjamin whether he would be willing to do the task.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I really think we need to talk about this,&rdquo; Benjamin said while stepping backwards in disapproval. &ldquo;Do you have a hose? Maybe we could hose the outside of the glass. You don&rsquo;t need someone to go outside. Or maybe the wind will blow it away? Have you tried tapping on the glass for a while to knock it loose?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Trust me young child, I have tried nothing. But, I am sure the only guaranteed way of removing the piece of dust for good is to go outside and get it. Otherwise, it could just go somewhere else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma looked at Benjamin with an expression that felt like she was already preparing the harness. Benjamin looked at Selma with an expression that was purely disapproval with her decision. But if he wanted to go home, he decided he would do it. He didn&rsquo;t come this way for nothing. At this point in his adventure, he learned to just do things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let out a long sigh and Selma ran to get the harness. She strapped Benjamin in place and Benjamin shook his head slowly with disbelief. He did not want to go outside. Not here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there a helmet?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s a helmet!&rdquo; Selma yelled with enthusiasm as she thumped the helmet on his head. &ldquo;Look at you! You&rsquo;re an explorer ready to clean some windows!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at himself and wondered how he had gotten himself into such a mess. Selma nearly pushed him to a glass window from where Benjamin could step outside onto the spherical glass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold onto the rope and as soon as you want to come back inside, just give it a good tug,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope was attached to the top of the room by a pulley with one end connected to Benjamin and the other end connected to a wheel that looked like it belonged on an ocean ship. Selma used all of her weight to turn the wheel, giving Benjamin more rope with which he could step outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I really think--&rdquo; he started to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Off you go!&rdquo; Selma yelled with excited enthusiasm as she gave the wheel a full turn. Benjamin nearly fell outside the window with the sudden slack in the rope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in white stood without making a sound, adjusting his hat and cane every so often. His eyes focused on the small piece of dust that Benjamin was going to retrieve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin, for his part, couldn&rsquo;t even see the dust from the window. It was so small he had no idea where it was. But as he leaned outside the window, he decided he would move in the general direction of the dust. Benjamin&rsquo;s thoughts were as cloudy as the skyline in the distance. He couldn&rsquo;t make any sense of what he was about to do. He also could not understand how Selma could have such a wide smile as she was currently wearing. With one more glance of disbelief, he turned and stepped onto the glass ceiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was worse than he expected. Outside of the glass skyscraper, it was windy, cold, scary, frightening, terrifying, excruciating, and traumatizing. Benjamin positioned his feet against the glass so he could walk down the side of the wall. As he started to walk down, he could see Selma and her big smile spinning the ship&rsquo;s wheel as fast as she could. As she spun and spun, the man pointed his cane lower and lower, indicating that Benjamin needed to walk further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought he&rsquo;d be in this kind of situation and decided that he needed to find that piece of dust as fast as possible. This was worse than most of his nightmares.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he stepped lower and lower, he came within eyesight of where the man was pointing. Selma kept spinning and spinning. And as he tried to get closer to the glass to find the one spec of dirt that had soiled this otherwise perfect, pristine skyscraper he slipped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma stopped spinning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in white jolted forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Benjamin slammed into the side of the skyscraper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn&rsquo;t painful, it was embarrassing. But with eyes now as close to the glass as they could be, he saw the spec of dust. He couldn&rsquo;t believe it. It was smaller than he expected and absolutely impossible for the average person to see. He picked it up and showed it to Selma and the man in white who eagerly nodded their heads up and down. Benjamin put it in his pocket and Selma spun the wheel the opposite direction as quickly as she could.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Walking back into the glass sphere was a lot easier than walking out. Benjamin felt that way about most places, that it was a lot easier returning than it was going. But in this case, he was thousands of feet above the ground tied to a rope that was being controlled by his inexplicably happy classmate on the other side.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>So when he got back inside the room, he felt nothing but accomplishment for having found the piece of dust.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he yelled as he removed his harness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you were a goner,&rdquo; Selma said with an expression that was much more worried than he had seen before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it but I got it! Your castle is now clean of dirt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stepped forward and handed the spec of dust to the man in white. It looked like a tiny dot on his white gloves. The man removed his monocle and looked at it closely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I cannot believe it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean. Wow. Just wow. You really went out there and got this spec of dust?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; Benjamin said proudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean. That&rsquo;s just nuts. Wow. I can&rsquo;t believe you went out there. No one goes out there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No one?&rdquo; Benjamin was confused at how shocked the man was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No one! You&rsquo;ve got to be insane to go out there! Everyone leaves. They all go back down the elevator and never come back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They leave?&rdquo; Benjamin was even more confused as to why he did what he just did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean. That was impressive! I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be able to do it. Wow. You&rsquo;re a really nuts kid. You were outside the window! You were thousands of feet in the air. That&rsquo;s crazy, right? Crazy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin crossed his arms and noticed Selma did the same. They were not excited by the man&rsquo;s game that they had just played.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You mean I didn&rsquo;t have to go outside to get the piece of dust?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to! I thought the two of you would leave!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know you were playing a game.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sorry about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So can we see the travel agent now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why of course! I mean, anyone that would go outside this room certainly needs a vacation. Anyone that comes up here just goes back down. They want to leave, especially if it means doing what you just did. You both need a vacation! You might be the first two to take a vacation since I&rsquo;ve been here,&rdquo; he said as he grabbed the doorknob behind him. &ldquo;Here, go inside. The travel agent is inside. You can leave the boxes here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin and Selma walked inside, exchanging annoyed glances with each other and the crazy man dressed in white.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oops,&rdquo; Selma whispered to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Oops.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated at a small desk in this room made of black glass, Benjamin saw a woman who looked exactly like a peacock. Her hair was every color and extended as wide as the room. It was as brilliant and perfect as all of the glass castle. And as she raised her tiny head, Benjamin saw one of the prettiest women he had ever seen. She tilted her head to the side and slowly moved her lips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why hello you two and welcome to Dream Travels LLC,&rdquo; she said as elegantly as one could say such words. &ldquo;And, where would you like to go today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;New York.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.smjkksot5qx7"></a><span>Chapter 25: In Which There Is A Queen</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Castle Ehtsetra was silent. Benjamin knew that any people who had previously been stirring thousands of feet below had stopped. Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. Except, that was, for the travel agent who tapped her pen on the nameplate on her desk. It read </span><span class="c4">Lizette Gohara, Travel Agent of Dream Excellence</span><span>. She tapped her named steadily. But, she ground her teeth with increasingly tense ferocity.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;He means he&rsquo;d like to go to Castle Newer,&rdquo; Selma said as she pushed Benjamin away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what he said,&rdquo; Lizette Gohara responded tersely. &ldquo;He said he wanted to go to New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I misspoke,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly. &ldquo;I meant Castle Newer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No one misspeaks that eloquently,&rdquo; Lizetta Gohara continued. &ldquo;How do you know about this place, New York?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lizette Gohara stood from her desk, the hair on her head touching three walls of the room. She leaned forward on her desk and brought her face within inches of Benjamin&rsquo;s. Her eyes narrowed and Benjamin felt like she was trying to read his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;It was a mistake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are no mistakes,&rdquo; Lizette Gohara said as she spaced out her words longer and longer. &ldquo;There are only surprises. How do you know where New York is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin did not know how to respond and so he looked to Selma for advice. But unfortunately, Lizette Gohara had her hand over Selma&rsquo;s mouth. She could not help him now. Benjamin had to answer for himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because, I want to go home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lizette Gohara stood back as quickly as she had moved forward. Benjamin did not want to lie. He knew lying was wrong. And, he was going to the travel agency so that he could find a way back home. If he lied, he could be further away from where he wanted to be. And so, Benjamin felt fine with answering the question as best as he thought he could answer it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m from,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Lizette Gohara said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met anyone from New York before. I mean, I&rsquo;ve certainly heard of it. But, here you are standing before me, flesh and blood, a living New Yorker.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He means Castle Newer,&rdquo; Selma said as she moved Lizette Gohara&rsquo;s hand away from her mouth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s delusional and he doesn&rsquo;t know where he needs to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, young girl. I think your friend knows exactly where he&rsquo;d like to go. He&rsquo;d like to leave this land. He&rsquo;d like to go to New York.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He says that but he doesn&rsquo;t know where New York is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, regardless, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to help you get to New York,&rdquo; Lizette Gohara said as she moved around her desk to a large filing cabinet against a wall. &ldquo;I can, however, offer you some fantastic prices on trips that have been extremely popular this year.&rdquo; She turned her head to face both Selma and Benjamin. &ldquo;Would you like to hear about them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chill ripped through Benjamin&rsquo;s body as he feared what this woman was capable of doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Selma and Benjamin said in unison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s wonderful! Let&rsquo;s start with the islands!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lizette Gohara threw open a cabinet door and pulled out several posters featuring many islands. She danced around the room as a ballet dancer would move about a stage. She placed posters on every wall, posters of islands Benjamin had never seen before. He did not know such places existed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Islands, you see, are beautiful places to be. You can escape. You can be alone. You can have your own personal, lovely prison-- I mean vacation! Vacation! What do you think? Shall we send the two of your to an island?&rdquo; Lizette Gohara said as she once again leaned so close to Benjamin and Selma&rsquo;s faces that Benjamin thought they would touch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How would we get there?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any islands from here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lizette Gohara pretended to look through the window to see if she could identify any islands in the distance. Benjamin knew there were no islands because he could see everything when he was removing that small spec of dust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right. You cannot see any of the islands here. It&rsquo;ll be a longer train ride and you&rsquo;ll eventually have to take a boat. But, it&rsquo;s quite safe and the boats haven&rsquo;t sunk in many years. So what do you say, would you like to see the islands?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin knew he did not want to go to the islands. He wanted to go home and an island meant that he would be stuck somewhere else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would do well on the islands.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like the sun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of sharks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go in the water.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably go in the water.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in the water. There are sharks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have anything on land?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lizette Gohara tore down all the posters and danced back to the cabinet where she opened another shelf. This time, she began to place posters on the wall of beautiful mountain resorts with waterfalls that clung onto the sides of cliffs as they weaved through trees and grass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If the islands aren&rsquo;t to your liking, how about an escape to the mountains where there promises to be amazing wildlife, adventure, and certainly no sharks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That is much better, I suppose, because of there being no sharks,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, then you&rsquo;ll take it! I can book a trip for two to leave in an hour. Does that work? Would you like to spend your vacation in a place your friends will be jail, I mean jealous of. They&rsquo;ll be jealous. I&rsquo;m sure of it. So, two then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think we want to go on a long train ride,&rdquo; Selma said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A long train ride?&rdquo; Lizette Gohara asked with confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Selma said slowly. &ldquo;Do you have any trips that go to many places in a short period of time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. All the trips I have ready to schedule go to one place. I mean, you&rsquo;ll stay in one place. It&rsquo;s not that they all go to the same place. That would be silly,&rdquo; Lizette Gohara laughed loudly in a quite obnoxious way. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have any trips that would take you around from place to place. Why would you want such a thing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin thought he knew what Selma was planning. If they travelled from place to place, eventually they would find an exit. He was beginning to question whether Lizette Gohara was telling the truth or not. He was beginning to think that she was not as real as he thought she might be. In fact, he began to wonder if she had an plan of her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We like to ride trains,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not ones to stay still.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, obviously not. I mean, you&rsquo;ve presumably been to New York--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Castle Newer,&rdquo; Selma interjected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I doubt it&rsquo;s Castle Newer,&rdquo; Lizette Gohara said slowly as her eyebrows started to narrow. &ldquo;I doubt you have any interest in Castle Newer. No one wants to go to Castle Newer.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Lizette Gohara was walking slowly to Selma, her arms at her sides like a preying mantis approaching a small insect. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s something you two are trying to hide from me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>She grabbed Selma by the shoulders and stared deep into her eyes. Benjamin did not know how to react. He stepped backward until he touched the wall. He wanted to help Selma but he didn&rsquo;t know how. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;And you know what,&rdquo; Lizette Gohara continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you care?&rdquo; Benjamin asked because he thought he could distract her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I care?&rdquo; Lizette Gohara said as she grabbed Benjamin and pushed him into Selma&rsquo;s shoulders. The two tried to free themselves but her strength was too much. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care because you two are going nowhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nowhere?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nowhere!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But now that I think about it, the islands sound great,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly. &ldquo;I can handle the sharks. I&rsquo;ll just stay out of the water.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You two will be going nowhere,&rdquo; she said fiercely. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a lie, actually. Guards!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door behind them burst open and dozens of men dressed in blue approached Benjamin and Selma. The guards grabbed their arms and legs to prevent them from moving. Benjamin felt himself being hoisted into the ground, unable to free himself of their grasps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both going to jail.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jail!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled. &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For trespassing! You&rsquo;re obviously not from here. And even worse, you might be from New York!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For the last time, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with New York!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Save it for the Queen. If you&rsquo;re not from here, you&rsquo;re a nightmare to deal with. And you, young lady,&rdquo; she said as she turned to Selma. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite disappointed that someone of your upbringing would associate with someone like him. It&rsquo;s quite shameful really. Don&rsquo;t you know any other little boys your own age of your own kind? Take them away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait! We just want to leave the castle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Away! Away with them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin and Selma were thrown into the elevator with the guards surrounding them. Not one of them made a sound as they descended to the ground. Benjamin was not sure where they were going but he knew that going to the travel agent was a bad idea. And unexpectedly, he saw in Selma&rsquo;s expression that she must have also realized it was a bad idea. He thought he saw her start to cry but she turned her face away from him quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have to leave,&rdquo; she said sternly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards didn&rsquo;t move. They stared at the number of floors remaining. There were still over two-thousand left and they were passing three floor every second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Benjamin asked in an attempt to whisper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re surrounded by guards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Selma blurted out. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think of something but we cannot get in trouble here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;ll happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards all cleared their throats at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about it,&rdquo; Selma said as she sulked into the corner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time since he saw her, Benjamin realized that Selma was capable of being defeated. She had always been so strong and forceful that he never imagined someone like her could also be vulnerable. It made him start to wonder if someone as scared and cowardly could be the opposite as well. And if Selma was feeling down at that moment, he knew that he had to be the one to bring her back. She had led him for so long. It was his turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elevator reached the second floor, it stopped. Benjamin thought that certainly no one would try to get on this elevator. There was no room. And, no one was trying to get on. He, Selma, and the guards were all going to leave. The guards hurried them from the elevator and down a long hall to a dark purple glass room with a small sign that read </span><span class="c4">Judgment Room</span><span>. The guards shoved Benjamin and Selma into the empty room and then closed the door tightly. Benjamin heard three locks turn before he heard footsteps run away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know how we&rsquo;re going to get out of here,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t. But, he thought that if he convinced Selma that he had a plan, she would become less sad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have plan,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean? I have a plan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. I can tell when you&rsquo;re lying. Your eyebrows are always raised when you&rsquo;re lying and your eyebrows are raised right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paused for a second and shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe the plan was going to be amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he could respond, a television screen the size of one of the walls turned on and on it appeared a frail, skinny woman dressed in ornate white robes with a golden crown upon her head. She looked like she had just been woken from a nap and she moved her head and arms slowly. Benjamin thought she looked exactly like a sea turtle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you the trespassers?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Benjamin answered. &ldquo;We were here to book a vacation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, we don&rsquo;t book vacations to trespassers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t trespassing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, you would have been booked a vacation,&rdquo; she said as she wiped her mouth with a fuzzy cloth. The video occasionally had static that caused the image to distort. &ldquo;My name is Queen Sey Mour and I&rsquo;m here to hand you your judgment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong,&rdquo; Selma said sternly. &ldquo;And, you haven&rsquo;t listened to our story yet. You can&rsquo;t judge us without knowing what our story is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Selma, please,&rdquo; Queen Sey Mour said. Benjamin looked at Selma, not realizing that the young girl might know the older Queen. &ldquo;You should know better than to travel around with a nightmare of a boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a nightmare,&rdquo; Selma protested.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for discussion right now. We are here to discuss your punishment. And for that I decree that--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t punish us without hearing our side of the story,&rdquo; Selma protested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, I&rsquo;ve got lots of day dreams to handle today. I cannot deal with your behavior right now. If you want me to tell your mother where you are, you should continue behaving badly. But if you want me to not mention anything to her, I suggest you keep your mouth shut.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So it won&rsquo;t be a bad punishment?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For her, it won&rsquo;t. For nightmares, it will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a nightmare,&rdquo; Selma said as she stamped her foot on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I enjoyed hearing your story, Selma. Now, please quiet down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen of Sey Mour adjusted her sunglasses and read from a bright white piece of paper handed to her from someone offscreen. Benjamin watched as this old lady squinted her eyes like she was trying to find the words on the paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In the complaint of trespassing on Castle Ehtsetra, Selma Applebaum receives a punishment of a day of community service,&rdquo; the queen read.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin didn&rsquo;t think that the punishment was so harsh. Certainly, he wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing some community service as well. And if it meant he could eventually leave the castle to find another path to leave, he was fine with this punishment. He didn&rsquo;t know why he was so scared earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And in the complaint of trespassing on Castle Ehtsetra and for being a nightmare, the nightmare will have his head chopped off.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.lrf6xjwa3r9g"></a><span>Chapter 26: In Which There Is A Door</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The television screen shut off immediately. Benjamin and Selma stood alone in the room, both not looking at each other. It could not be real, Benjamin thought to himself. He knew he was trapped in this room but there could not be any chopping of heads anywhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Selma dragged the word out for a while. &ldquo;That was a surprise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;You got a day of community service and I&rsquo;m going to lose my head. That doesn&rsquo;t seem fair.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want me to lose my head?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I want a day of community service as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right. That would&rsquo;ve been better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So what do we do now?&rdquo; Benjamin asked as he realized this may be real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The way I see it we have two options. You can lose your head or we&rsquo;re going to have to escape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Or, I could convince them that I&rsquo;m not a nightmare. How can I do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. Once you&rsquo;re called a nightmare, you&rsquo;re stuck with it. The only way to convince anyone is to get King Bernard Zwirn to clear your name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, escape?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want to lose your head?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. Let&rsquo;s escape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dozens and dozens of guards dressed in blue stormed the room and took Selma and Benjamin away. There was no use struggling because they were outnumbered. Benjamin wondered how they were going to escape if they were constantly surrounded by so many people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were rushed through a long wide glass room with doors at the end that reached to the ceiling. Benjamin could already see what was ahead through the glass. There was some sort of glass platform with a glass guillotine positioned on top. As he was pushed outside the skyscraper into the open air, he could see that there was indeed a machine ready to remove his head. The reality of the situation sunk in. Not only would he not be able to get back home, he would be losing his head in the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, we have to do something!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled as he was being dragged up glass stairs to the top of the glass platform. &ldquo;Selma!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking, I&rsquo;m thinking!&rdquo; Selma yelled as she was taken to a viewing area at the base of the platform. She was chained to a chair and despite her struggles, she could not free herself. &ldquo;Run away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Run? I can&rsquo;t get myself free of their grips.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just run! I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin squirmed back and forth as the only guard on the platform pushed him closer and closer to the guillotine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not working, Selma!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Run! Or, jump! Any way you can to get out of here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin jumped and squirmed and attempted to run but in every attempt, he was being overpowered. The guard was too strong and Benjamin was too weak. He tried moving every part of his body but nothing could free himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Try harder!&rdquo; Selma yelled as the guards tightened her chains to the chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Benjamin jumped and inadvertently hit his head straight into the guard&rsquo;s head. Benjamin did not want to do this. It hurt. In his attempts to jump and move and free himself, it was an unavoidable collision. And despite the collision, the guard was physically uninjured. In fact, he was fine. But in the process of hitting the guard in the head, Benjamin knocked the man&rsquo;s sunglasses off his head. That was when something peculiar happened. The guard froze, his eyes wide open, staring forward. He was still alive. He was breathing. It was just that he looked like he was in a trance. So at that moment, Benjamin was free, at least from that one guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The sunglasses!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled to Selma. &ldquo;Knock their sunglasses off their faces!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma only had one hand free as the guards continued to tie her to the chair. But with that one hand, she swiped at one of the guard&rsquo;s faces and knocked his sunglasses to the ground. Immediately upon having the sunglasses removed, that guard too froze. And so, Selma swiped at the other guard who realized what had happened to his friend. He ducked away and continued to try to overpower Selma. But then, Benjamin ran down the stairs from the platform and hit his sunglasses onto the ground. The guard was stuck in a trance and Benjamin was able to release Selma from the chair as dozens of other guards descended upon them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one, Selma and Benjamin fought back against the men in blue suits. They ducked when the guards would try to grab them and then swung at their heads to remove their sunglasses. It was a fast, manic, panicked, energetic affair. Selma and Benjamin had knocked over forty sunglasses, leaving forty men staring into the distance. They didn&rsquo;t flinch. They didn&rsquo;t move. They just stayed in the position they were in when their sunglasses were removed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after Selma and Benjamin surrounded the last guard, jumping at his head to unhinge his sunglasses, they sat in the middle of these people, exhausted and confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good job,&rdquo; Selma said as they sat with their backs to one another, worried that more guards would be on their way. &ldquo;How did you know to remove the sunglasses?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he scanned the horizon for more blue suits. &ldquo;I accidentally knocked them off. I didn&rsquo;t even want to. What happened to them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma walked up to one of the guards and waved her hand in front of his eyes. He still didn&rsquo;t move. He was as still as a statue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re daydreaming,&rdquo; Selma said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Daydreaming?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. The sunglasses must prevent them from dreaming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So if they put the sunglasses back on, they&rsquo;ll come back to attack us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin jumped to his feet and gathered all of the sunglasses that had been strewn across the glass floor. When he had them all, he quickly broke each one of them into two pieces. This, he thought, would make them unusable to the guards. They could finally escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; he yelled to Selma as he grabbed her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran through a glass hallway, away from the guards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have to find the train that everyone takes when they start their holiday. The one that Lizette Gohara talked about. We&rsquo;ll get on that train and leave the castle,&rdquo; Selma said as they ran away, one pulling the other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they turned a corner, a video screen appeared on the glass wall in front of them. It flickered briefly and then Benjamin saw the unmistakable image of Queen Sey Mour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; Queen Sey Mour yelled. &ldquo;You stop running this instant!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin didn&rsquo;t think twice. He grabbed Selma&rsquo;s hand and pulled her along as they ran faster and faster. They moved through a glass maze in the castle&rsquo;s plaza, searching for a train. As they turned a corner, the screen with Queen Sey Mour appeared again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re going to leave?&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to leave, nightmare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continued running, turning whenever they thought one path might be better than another. Despite the walls and everything around them being made of glass, it was still difficult to find a train in the distance. It was especially difficult when Queen Sey Mour continued to appear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nightmare, you will not destroy my castle,&rdquo; Queen Sey Mour threatened. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin wished that he could explain to the woman that he was not a nightmare. But, this was not the time. He was not about to lose his head. He knew he needed to leave as quickly as possible. Another video screen appeared as Selma thought she saw the train preparing to depart.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Selma! I&rsquo;m informing your mother of your whereabouts!&rdquo; Queen Sey Mour screamed. &ldquo;We have fought the nightmares for a long time and they have finally been weakened! I will not have a nightmare in my castle destroyed dreams for innocent people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made Benjamin angry that Queen Sey Mour continued to refer to him as a nightmare. But, he kept his focus and continued to run faster, pulling Selma along even when she started to slow down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Selma yelled as a puff of smoke burst into the air above a train made of blue and red glass. &ldquo;Over there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran as the train started to lunge forward. One last screen appeared on the castle wall as Benjamin climbed the stairs on the side of the train.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nightmare, don&rsquo;t you ever return!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If you come back, you&rsquo;ll lose more than your head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train moved forward and Benjamin pulled Selma up the staircase with all of his strength. As the train departed the castle, the two children sat next to each other, physically exhausted and mentally beaten down. Surely, Benjamin thought, Queen Sey Mour would one day learn that he was not a nightmare. And in order for that day to occur, Benjamin needed to leave this place. He needed to go back to New York. Because here, he realized, he could not explain himself to people who were not willing to listen to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where does this go?&rdquo; Benjamin asked Selma about the train.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Selma said quickly. &ldquo;We just needed to leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin went through his backpack and removed the map that had been given to him by Myrna Delacourte. It was worn now. But, the exit and several other key places were still clearly visible. Benjamin scanned the skyline to see in what direction they might be headed. Selma watched Benjamin struggle with reading the map. It was frustrating to Benjamin because he could not easily figure out where he was. He pulled on his hair and rotated the map back and forth, still unable to guess where the train was going. He threw the map into his backpack and threw his head upon his hands. It seemed like he would never get back home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma reached across Benjamin and took his backpack. She opened his map and looked at it briefly, sharing the same confused face that Benjamin had. Benjamin didn&rsquo;t look up. He continued to sulk as he watched the ground move like a blur of color.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin turned his head to look in her direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said as she pointed at the map. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not marked. Castle Ehtsetra isn&rsquo;t marked. But, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin moved next to her so that he could look at the map as well. He didn&rsquo;t know if she was right but had a feeling that he should trust her. She knew a lot more than he did about this land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re close to the exit,&rdquo; he said as he pointed at the map.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s not too far away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If we ride the train for a little bit longer, we&rsquo;ll be able to get off and walk the rest of the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt a renewed sense of encouragement. Even if Selma was wrong, he was happy knowing that they had a plan. They would wait for the train to stop at the next station, and then they&rsquo;d walk to the exit. If the exit wasn&rsquo;t there, they would walk back to the train.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the train came to the station, Benjamin and Selma departed quickly, worried that there might have been other guards on the train. But as soon as they stepped from the train, it departed again, leaving them alone in a remote area. Birds flew from tree to tree while alligators roamed the stagnant water. It was an unlikely location for a train station because it did not seem like there was a castle nearby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma retrieved Benjamin&rsquo;s map and located where the exit might be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have to hurry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because we don&rsquo;t want to be here at night time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What happens at night time?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too close to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle. If he wanted to unleash nightmares, we would be the first to get them. We don&rsquo;t want to be here for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked along a thin dirt path that seemed to be the only evidence that people had been here before. As the sun continued to set, they picked up their pace and searched for the exit in the distance. Benjamin didn&rsquo;t know what an exit would look like because he could imagine that this land simply ended with a wall. It had to be something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As alligators snapped near their legs, Benjamin and Selma climbed over tree trunks and squeezed their way through thorny bushes to continue along. The path was becoming more muddy and with each step their shoes stuck to the ground. All of this, however, Benjamin was willing to endure because he was finally headed back to New York.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, they saw it. It was a red barn in the middle of the swamp with large white lettering that read </span><span class="c4">EXIT</span><span>. A humungous yellow arrow pointed to the door. It was quite remarkable and felt oddly out of place. But Benjamin did not care what it looked like. So long as it was the exit, he was fine with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they approached the door, Benjamin looked at Selma and held out his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; he said as he waited for her to shake his hand. &ldquo;Are you going to be able to get back alone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was confused why Selma didn&rsquo;t shake his hand. She looked at him like he was behaving in some foreign manner. Maybe, he thought, she just didn&rsquo;t like shaking hands. But Selma crossed her arms and began to narrow her eyebrows at Benjamin. He didn&rsquo;t know why she was getting upset and so, he decided it was well enough that he should be on his way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I really appreciate your help,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he turned to open the barn door, something was amiss. He didn&rsquo;t know why but something felt wrong. He couldn&rsquo;t put his finger on it. He had had an adventure. Perhaps, it was not the adventure that he had hoped for. But, it was an adventure and he had grown a little bit. He still didn&rsquo;t feel as courageous as he would have liked to be. He did feel, however, that he had grown a tad more independent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t know what it was that didn&rsquo;t feel right. But, he did know the door was locked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled and pulled and listened to Selma laughing behind him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as locked as a vault.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a key?&rdquo; Selma asked with disbelief. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t whoever gave you the map to the exit also give you a key?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin felt defeated. He had come all this way. He had found the exit. And, he never thought the exit might require a key.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought it would be open.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma laughed at his pitiful situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think if the exit was open we&rsquo;d have people always coming and going?&rdquo; she asked with a giggle. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t have a key!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where can I get a key?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He was getting a little angry. He had prepared himself to leave and had not anticipated that his only place to depart might be locked. It was excruciatingly painful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I only know one person that has a key,&rdquo; Selma said calmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how else you get a key. I thought you knew.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I thought that maybe it might be unlocked,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin marched back the way they had come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Selma asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a key. I&rsquo;m going to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.t9f05wpqg6ui"></a><span>Chapter 27: In Which There Is Nightmare Castle</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, Benjamin and Selma walked further than Benjamin had ever walked in a day. He was determined to get to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle and Selma was determined to make sure he did not get hurt along the way. She could barely keep pace with Benjamin he was moving as fast as his body could take him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Slow down!&rdquo; Selma yelled from behind. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no rush.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know you want to go home but whether you go home tonight or tomorrow or the next day or the day after that isn&rsquo;t going to make a difference.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma was exhausted. She had been through so much with Benjamin and she did not have the same goal that he had. In fact, so long as Benjamin did not hurt himself, she achieved her goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of being here and I want to go home. And if that means going into Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle to get a key, I&rsquo;m going to get it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin didn&rsquo;t even notice how confident and courageous he had suddenly become. He was about to enter a castle that produced nightmares with the intentions of retrieving a key. It was not, he thought, going to be easy. But, he saw no other way to get home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get killed if you don&rsquo;t stop and think for a moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to think about anymore. I&rsquo;m going to go into the castle. I&rsquo;m going to find King Bernard Zwirn. I&rsquo;m going to get the key. And then, I&rsquo;m walking back to the exit in the swamp. And then, I&rsquo;ll say goodbye to you again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma didn&rsquo;t want to stop Benjamin&rsquo;s enthusiasm for getting the key. She knew that it was his only way home. King Bernard Zwirn was the only person who knew where Benjamin had come from. He was the only person that could actually send Benjamin home. But to get to King Bernard Zwirn in Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle was as dangerous as trying to spoonfeed a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; Benjamin pointed to a volcano in the distance that spewed lava thousands of feet into the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma took one look and gave Benjamin a thumbs up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle. I&rsquo;ve never been there. I&rsquo;ve only seen drawings. And it looks so much worse in person than it does in anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen. You know, Benjamin. I wonder if there&rsquo;s another way we can get you back home. Maybe we can go back to Castle Ehtahl and get the others. We&rsquo;ll bring them all back and then we can all go in together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma turned to face Benjamin and upon doing so, she noticed that he had already left and was walking down a hill to the castle that sat in the volcano a mile away. She let out a loud sigh and then ran to catch up with Benjamin. Benjamin was still so focused on finding an exit he did not consider the alternatives that might happen. His only alternative that he worried about was not getting home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go inside,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;So you can wait outside if you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If I want?&rdquo; Selma asked with confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is my problem. You don&rsquo;t have to go inside if you don&rsquo;t want to. It&rsquo;s going to be dangerous and all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, it&rsquo;s going to be beyond dangerous. This is one of the worst places imaginable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not the worst place imaginable?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, no. But any castle that produces nightmares is an awful place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dozen. They all surround a fortress in the middle some distance away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the fortress?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, so do you have any recommendations for how I can get inside?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, the first thing is that you should probably try not to get killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll try not to get killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s about it. These nightmares are awful. It took our castles decades to keep all the nightmares away. They&rsquo;ve been here for so long and have only recently started to attack us again. Fighting nightmares is one of the most difficult things I know of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, no advice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any,&rdquo; she said as she threw her hands in the air. &ldquo;If we knew how to destroy the nightmares, we would have done it already.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll just try to stay alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just try to stay alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked up the volcano, dodging lava and ash as it fell from the sky all around them. It started to get louder and noisier the closer they got to the walls, a sound that was similar to a boiling pot of water. The walls were darker and taller than any of the walls Benjamin had yet seen. They were dirty and smelly and covered with disgusting liquids that rolled down their sides. And unexpectedly, there was no door. There was no drawbridge or doorbell or small opening in which Benjamin could enter. It looked like the kind of place that did not let anything inside leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin could hear the sounds of screaming and yelling as he approached the rocky exterior of a wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; Selma yelled as she pulled him behind a piece of cooled lava. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to see you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Benjamin asked as he ducked near Selma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, three screeching dragons the size of buses flew overhead. Benjamin could see fire in their eyes and their talons looked like they could break anything with ease. They flew around in a pattern like they were searching for something inside the castle. The screams grew louder as the dragons hissed and snarled at something on the other side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have to climb the wall,&rdquo; Selma said to Benjamin. &ldquo;But only once the dragons disappear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We?&rdquo; Benjamin asked her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m going to let you go in there and die? Do you know how much work it&rsquo;ll be for me to explain to everyone what happened to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Which wall?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; Selma said as she pointed to a wall that had more darkness upon it than the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more dragons soared around the castle, Benjamin and Selma sprinted to the wall. A glass wall would have been difficult to climb. But this wall was rather easier because it had been damaged so many times by falling lava. And Benjamin was beginning to think that the walls weren&rsquo;t built so that they could keep people out. They had been built to keep the nightmares inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They climbed the wall, rocks slipping underneath them as they went higher. Benjamin noticed that he was further up than Selma and so, he stopped and held his position. He didn&rsquo;t want to be in a place where he couldn&rsquo;t help her if she needed it. When Selma got to his spot, they climbed side by side until they reached the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the top, Benjamin saw the worst sight he had ever seen. On the other side of the wall was the largest army Benjamin had ever seen. Aloysius Trenhaile was preparing for war. He was going to attack Castle Ehtahl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle was littered with broken houses made of rock that lined lava rivers. There were rusty military vehicles that looked like they had been inspired by porcupines, spikes coming out of every side. There were weapons that seemed large enough to destroy any castle Benjamin had seen. And throughout, there were trolls who grunted and growled at each other. There were more skeletons than Benjamin could count on the far east end of the castle. And when one of them moved, Benjamin&rsquo;s stomach turned. There were ghosts scattered throughout and awful creatures that Benjamin could not name everywhere. They looked like the horrifying creatures that only a nightmare could produce. It was worse than Benjamin imagined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; he said to Selma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stay alive,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;The key is going to be with King Bernard Zwirn. And, he&rsquo;s probably held captive in that tower.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the castle was a tower that even lava could not destroy. It had a staircase that wrapped around its exterior dozens of times before it reached the top. The dark, dirty exterior made it almost invisible against the night sky. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the large fire at the top, Benjamin was sure he would have missed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We just have to get to the top somehow,&rdquo; Benjamin said to Selma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scanned the castle for an easy path to the tower but it was difficult to find given the darkness. The stairs were the most obvious choice, he thought. But, he would probably be seen. If there was a way he could disguise himself, he could walk through unseen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was going to whisper his plan to Selma, the three dragons suddenly appeared on the other side of the castle walls. They stared at Benjamin and Selma who were only ten feet away. Benjamin could feel the searing hot air the dragons were exhaling. They were doomed, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the dragons grabbed Selma and flew into the darkness. Benjamin tried to reach for her but it was too late. The other two dragons grabbed Benjamin and flew him across the castle and above the lava river. He was certain that he was going to die at that moment. The dragons would tear him to pieces. It was a dreadful situation and Benjamin did not know how to free himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wished that he could fall. If he was so hot or so cold that he would hurt the dragons, they would drop him. Or, if he was made of spikes or if he was slippery, they would drop him. Or, if he was extremely heavy or big or tiny or unseen, they would drop him. And at that moment, all he wanted was to be dropped, safely and not torn to pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and imagined what it would be like to be all those things that the dragons couldn&rsquo;t hold. And suddenly and unexpectedly, he opened his eyes and found himself in a freefall. There was not much distance between him and the ground but with lava everywhere, he was still concerned. Luckily, he fell directly into the back of a cart filled with coal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma!&rdquo; he yelled into the empty darkness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cart jolted forward and Benjamin hid among the coal. The army was much larger than Benjamin had guessed. He looked ahead and noticed that he was only a short distance away from the tower. But he also noticed that the cart was headed directly for the staircase that ran along the tower. As it approached, Benjamin saw that the disgusting troll that was pulling the cart was going to attempt to pull the cart up the staircase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll pulled the cart up one step and Benjamin was jostled back and forth. He did not like being thrown about in such a violent way. The troll pulled the cart up another step and Benjamin hit his head against the iron wall of the cart. And then another step and Benjamin hit his back against the coal. There were hundreds of stairs and if the troll was going to continue to pull the cart this way, Benjamin thought he would be unconscious before he arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He imagined what it would be like if there were no steps going up but instead it was a smooth ride all the way to top. It would be a gentle ride and the troll could go a little faster. And when he got to the top, Benjamin could still have his consciousness. When he stopped imagining what such a ride would be like, he opened his eyes and realized that he was at the top of the tower. The sight baffled him. Although the tower looked high from the ground, it felt much taller here. And, he could see the full violence and size of the volcano. It was dreadful and around it, thousands of beasts prepared for battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin waited for the troll to leave and then he snuck into the tower&rsquo;s square room where a large fire burned at the top. As soon as he entered, he heard a familiar voice that he had not heard from for a really long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin?&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn asked.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The king was seated in an iron cage stuck in the air. Although it hadn&rsquo;t been a long time since Benjamin had last seen him, he looked remarkably older and weaker. Benjamin knew the king was in trouble. There was no one else in the room. There was just a gigantic fire and a loud, vibrating machine in the middle.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin! What are you doing here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story but I&rsquo;m trying to leave,&rdquo; Benjamin whispered. &ldquo;And I need a key to leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t get you out earlier, Benjamin. I didn&rsquo;t expect things to go this direction. And you can&rsquo;t stay here. I don&rsquo;t know how you got in but you&rsquo;re in a lot of trouble. If my brother finds you, you&rsquo;re going to be in a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Your brother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, my brother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Your brother is Aloysius Trenhaile?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>The fire roared and lightning struck the tower. The demons, ghosts, and horrid creatures all screamed in unison at the base of the castle.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin, you cannot say that name!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming back. He&rsquo;s making nightmares. Benjamin, you should probably leave. I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;ll be able to help me. You just have to tell someone that I&rsquo;m still alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Selma,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Selma&rsquo;s with you? Yes, I got kicked out of Castle Ehtahl by Thalia Nachamie.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I thought Thalia Nachamie might have taken control. It&rsquo;s not good times for dreaming, Benjamin. Dreams may soon come to an end. So, you should leave. If my brother finds you, he&rsquo;s going to try to hurt you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another roar in the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;King Zwirn, how can we destroy the nightmares?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been able to figure it out, Benjamin. If we can stop this machine here, we&rsquo;ll be able to temporarily stop their production. But so long as there are dreams, there are bound to be people who want to create nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So if I turn off this machine, I&rsquo;ll have stopped the nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, but we don&rsquo;t know how to turn it off. My brother is the only person who knows.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything. You don&rsquo;t have much time. You&rsquo;re in real danger. The key is on the other side of the room and you need to get it quickly before my brother returns.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked and spotted the small silver key on the other side of the room. He ran to the wall and climbed an iron ladder that led to the ceiling. With one hand after another, Benjamin imagined scaling the ladder faster than he felt he was capable of moving. When he arrived at the top, he grabbed the key and could hear King Bernard Zwirn applauding on the other side. Benjamin turned and saw the largest smile he had ever seen the king wear. But Benjamin did not realize what he had done. He had simply climbed the ladder. And now, he could finally leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bravo, Benjamin!&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn yelled. &ldquo;Now, leave! Go find someone who can help save me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without thinking, Benjamin ran down the ladder as quickly as he had climbed up it. He hit the ground and held the key out for King Bernard Zwirn to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you got in here, Benjamin,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn said. &ldquo;But if there&rsquo;s anyone who knows how to escape, it&rsquo;s probably you. Trust your own instincts and tell everyone that I&rsquo;m still alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So long, King Zwirn,&rdquo; Benjamin yelled in response. &ldquo;It was great to meet you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye, Benjamin. I hope you can continue dreaming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin turned to leave and immediately upon trying to exit, Aloysius Trenhaile appeared.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.1zxmxan73v43"></a><span>Chapter 28: In Which There Is A Nightmarer</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was much taller than Benjamin expected. His body was thin like a crane. He stood like a young tree with branches arms that stretched outward like crooked branches. His fingers extended outwards like long, narrow daggers. His elbows, knees, and shoulders were sharp, not smooth like a normal person&rsquo;s. His feet were narrow and long while his ears were wide and short. His nose arched forward like a parrot&rsquo;s nose and his eyes sunk into his face like coals on a beach. And as he walked toward Benjamin, he moved like a sly fox stalking his prey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, this is the one?&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile asked King Bernard Zwirn amid lightning and thunder. &ldquo;You told me I&rsquo;d never come upon him. That he&rsquo;d come upon me. And with what luck, here he is. What is your name, child?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin hadn&#39;t moved. He didn&rsquo;t know how to interact with this man that had been so feared by so many. This man was responsible for destroying dreams in the castles and he had an army ready to destroy dreams forever. He was the reason dreams were disappearing in New York.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Leave the boy alone!&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn yelled from the cage. &ldquo;He causes you no harm. Let him be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloysius Trenhaile walked around Benjamin several times, his legs taking long strides. His hands were behind his back. Benjamin felt like the man was going to grab him if he tried to flee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bernard, that can&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile said calmly. &ldquo;Any child that comes to my castle surely is not worthy of letting go free. Why is he here, Bernard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He was just leaving, Aloysius! Let him be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But why leave now? Don&rsquo;t you want to see the release of my greatest creation yet? I was just about to create a nightmare&rsquo;s nightmare. Stick around, boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chains burst from the ground and wall. They wrapped themselves around Benjamin&rsquo;s arms and legs so quickly that Benjamin didn&rsquo;t have any time to react. The rusty chains pulled Benjamin into the air next to King Bernard Zwirn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can stay there,&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile said with an annoyed, calm voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be witness to something that will change human history. This will revolutionize the way people live. This will change the way people think. For too long, there has been a divide between the people who can dream and those who cannot. But, nightmares do not discriminate. Nightmares affect everyone. And tonight, this machine will make sure that no one dreams. The dreamers will stop dreaming and be just like the people who are unable to dream.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Benjamin said meekly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you understand. Nightmares are fair. Dreams are unfair. Not everyone can dream, boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make dreams for the people who cannot dream?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloysius Trenhaile let out a long, loud laugh that caused the fire at the top of the room to roar. Benjamin tried to avert his eyes as lava fell throughout the room from the volcano outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You assume that everyone wants to dream!&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile screamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone wants a dream,&rdquo; Benjamin replied without thinking that responding might make the situation much worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile exclaimed. &ldquo;Everyone does not want a dream! Lots of people want to live life without a dream! The dreamers always think that everyone should have a dream. But, they&rsquo;re wrong! And for that, boy, the dreamers will be punished! The dreamers will be nightmarers!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nightmarers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes! They will no longer have dreams but nightmares!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, that&rsquo;s not even a word.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Bernard Zwirn put his finger to his lips and shook his head back and forth quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, Benjamin. Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn whispered to Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nightmarers is now a word. I invented it. It means a dreamer who only has nightmares!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin didn&rsquo;t understand what had led Aloysius Trenhaile to come to this conclusion. If there were no dreamers, the world would be a sadder place, he thought. It would be filled with people who just did what they were told, people who did not think beyond what they saw, people who did not care about creativity, people who did not try to stretch their minds, people who were insecure, people who were afraid of being different, people who were exactly the same as everyone else. It seemed to be an awful place. And, it was certainly a place Benjamin did not want to live. He wanted dreams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bring in the catalyst!&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile yelled as he inspected the complicated nightmare machine in the center of the room. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>It was made of many electrical parts Benjamin could not identify. It looked so much more complicated than the dream machine in Cafe Ehtahl. From four doors on all sides of the room, demons entered with various pieces of equipment. They began to plug cords into the nightmare machine and pull levers that sent sparks flying into the air. The nightmare machine was slowly coming to life.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh, one more thing, Bernard,&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile said amid the chaos of the awful creatures running around. &ldquo;We have the girl, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Selma!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span>&ldquo;Aloysius, you let her go! She&rsquo;s here to do no harm!&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn yelled back.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;s here. I assume she&rsquo;s here to save you. But, we both know you can&rsquo;t be saved,&rdquo; Aloysius replied.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Trolls entered and began putting the finishing touches on the nightmare machine, which started to make lots of noise and generate more sparks. Every so often, a spark would explode so much that it looked like a firework. To Benjamin, the nightmare machine looked like it was going to explode. Even the demons and trolls and other disgusting beasts on the floor began to look at it with fear. Some slowly backed away and ran down the exterior staircase while others admired the lights and noises with amazement. Benjamin and King Bernard Zwirn continued to avert their eyes. It was too bright to look directly at and too loud to hear.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Benjamin, you have to get out of here,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin looked at the chains that held him in the air. He jostled his body back and forth but could not free himself.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;How did you get to this castle? How did you get up this tower? How did you climb that broken ladder to get that key? That ladder only goes halfway up the wall but you somehow managed to climb a ladder all the way to the top.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin looked across the room and noticed that the ladder did indeed stop halfway up the wall. But, that wasn&rsquo;t what he remembered. He remembered climbing a ladder all the way to the top. In fact, he was sure a ladder went all the way to the top because he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to climb it otherwise. And yet as he looked across the room, the ladder definitely stopped well short. Maybe, he thought, he imagined it. Maybe that was why King Bernard Zwirn was clapping as loudly as he was. Maybe it was all in Benjamin&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You can free yourself, Benjamin. You&rsquo;re the only one who can. You just have to imagine yourself being freed,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn whispered. &ldquo;I believe you can do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin didn&rsquo;t understand what the king meant. He didn&rsquo;t try to create a ladder that extended all the way to the top of the ceiling. He didn&rsquo;t try to move the troll and the coal cart from the bottom of the tower to the top. He didn&rsquo;t try to do anything. They just sort of happened. How could I try to imagine something so creative, he thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>His mind started to wonder as he watched pieces of lava fly into the room through the open roof above. He wondered how it was possible that he hadn&rsquo;t been hit by lava yet. He was glad he hadn&rsquo;t been hit by lava because that surely would have hurt. But with all of the pieces falling into the room, it was surprising that nothing hit him, King Bernard Zwirn, or the nightmare machine that Aloysius Trenhaile continued to work on. If only a piece of lava would fall through the ceiling and hit the iron chains, Benjamin would be free. He imagined how it would be, a small piece of lava moving so fast that it would melt the chains instantly and let him free.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And the next thing he realized, he was on the ground.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Aloysius Trenhaile turned to face Benjamin, his face as angry and upset as a face could make. He started to march toward Benjamin but Benjamin closed his eyes and imagined that lava was hailing down on the nightmare machine. Aloysius Trenhaile screamed and roared loudly. Benjamin opened his eyes to find that the machine had been hit by lava several times. Trolls and demons ran back into the room. They desperately tried to control the melting structure and fire that had started on the machine.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You are going to die!&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile screamed at Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin moved backwards and looked up to King Bernard Zwirn.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;You did it! Leave!&rdquo; the king yelled. &ldquo;Go! Hurry! Find Selma!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin turned and ran down the exterior of the tower, listening to the king shout instructions to him as he moved.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;That will stop them for now. Go find Selma and tell the others that I&rsquo;m alive! They must come at once to free me. It will take all the dream castles to destroy this castle but we must do so before Aloysius has an opportunity to create this nightmare&rsquo;s nightmare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He didn&rsquo;t know where Selma might be. All around him, the awful creatures of Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle began to stir with confusion as to what was happening at the top of the tower. It was chaos and amid it all, Benjamin yelled for Selma wherever he could. The last thing he remembered was that she was taken away by a dragon. So if he found a dragon, he could find Selma.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>In the sky, there was a dragon in the distance and Benjamin watched where it was headed. As trolls and skeletons climbed the tower, Benjamin proceeded to descend and follow where the dragon went. As it neared the castle, it changed directions quickly to fly toward the tower. And as it flew up the tower, Benjamin saw the other two dragons leave a destroyed house near the lava river.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He ran as quickly as he could and crossed a terribly hot bridge over the lava. Without thinking, he busted down the door. But there was no monster, only Selma and her foot chained to the ground. Without thinking, Benjamin imagined the roof being pulled off the house and a small piece of lava melting the chain. When he opened his eyes, he saw that the roof was gone, the iron chain had been cut, and Selma had a shocked expression on her face.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;We have to hurry!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled to her.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>She still didn&rsquo;t move so Benjamin grabbed her arm and led her through the destroyed castle and onto the bridge over the lava river. They ran among the chaos of trolls and ghosts trying to make their way up to the tower. At the top, Benjamin could see that the fire was raging more and more. He worried about King Bernard Zwirn but he knew he had his instructions. He had to get help.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Selma yelled as they ran further.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Aloysius Trenhaile created a nightmare machine that can create a nightmare&rsquo;s nightmare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;A nightmare&rsquo;s nightmare. It&rsquo;s a nightmare that will stop everyone from dreaming. There would be no more dreamers. Only nightmarers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a word.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I tried to tell him but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;So we have to stop it!&rdquo; Selma yelled.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; Benjamin replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly how but lava melted parts of it. They can&rsquo;t use it. It&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Did you find King Zwirn?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I did. He&rsquo;s up there in the tower. I got the key and then Aloysius entered and started the nightmare machine. I was chained to the wall and I imagined lava destroying the machine and setting me free. And then, I realized I was free. Aloysius is really angry right now. We have to leave before he finds me or else he&rsquo;ll kill me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Wait! Wait. I&rsquo;m confused. Why didn&rsquo;t you set King Zwirn free too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin paused for a moment while they were running to think. He could have set King Zwirn free but that wasn&rsquo;t what King Zwirn told him to do. He told Benjamin to leave and get help. And, that&rsquo;s what Benjamin was going to do.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;He told me to leave and get help. He said that I should let everyone know that he is still alive. Everyone needs to come back and battle this castle,&rdquo; Benjamin said to Selma.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>She didn&rsquo;t look pleased with his response but continued to sprint for the wall.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;So he wants us to get help?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Yes, he said get the other castles to free him. I guess he thought that Aloysius could only be defeated by the castles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>At that moment, the fire at the top of the castle exploded into a large fireball that forced both Benjamin and Selma to turn away. He saw demons and ghosts and skeletons falling off the staircase that surrounded the tower. If they did not move more quickly for the exit, Aloysius may find them.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin and Selma reached the wall and climbed it as fast as they could. At the top, Benjamin reached into his pocket and tightened a fist around the key. It was still there. King Bernard Zwirn was still at the top of the tower. But now, Benjamin could make sure that everyone knew he was still alive. Selma knew and when Selma went back to Castle Ehtahl, she could tell everyone. They would all come back and set the king free. He would be safe.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And for that night, there would still be dreamers because Benjamin had damaged the nightmare machine. Aloysius Trenhaile could not execute his plan without fixing it first. When the castles free King Bernard Zwirn, the king should be able to lead everyone in defeating Aloysius Trenhaile for good.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>This was good, Benjamin thought. He could finally go home to New York.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He nodded as he looked as the disaster before him and then climbed down the other side of the wall. When he got to the bottom, he assisted Selma in safely touching ground. But unexpectedly, Selma didn&rsquo;t share the same happy emotion that he had.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And, he didn&rsquo;t know why.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.mqf34hbta0bo"></a><span>Chapter 29: In Which There Is A Realization</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was ecstatic. He had done it. He had the key. He had done something that he never imagined he was capable of doing. And now, he could leave. He could exit this awful land that had been nothing but difficult and painful. He wanted to go home because although home didn&rsquo;t have any friends or dreams, he was not under attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t realize how fast he was walking away from the castle. As excited as he was, he felt as if he was flying. He moved along the land so quickly that he was far ahead of Selma who was only steps outside of the castle. Benjamin turned and started walking backwards so that he could see her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We did it!&rdquo; he yelled to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around and continued to move faster and faster. After everything he had gone through, events had turned in his favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is wrong with you!&rdquo; Selma screamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had her arms stretched as wide as they could extend and her head was pushed forward as far as it could go. Benjamin had not yet seen her this angry. She looked as if he had done something terrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Benjamin said warmly. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong with me. I&rsquo;m really happy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you nuts!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, look I have the key.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my--,&rdquo; Selma started to say but stopped and paced back and forth. Benjamin watched her pace and grunt loudly with frustration and annoyance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you so angry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you serious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t know what to ask next. He needed to figure out what was wrong with Selma but he wasn&rsquo;t sure how to get her to tell him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little confused why you&rsquo;re so upset.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re confused! Great! You&rsquo;re confused!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, so, you could, you know, tell me why you&rsquo;re so upset? That might be, well, nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma stopped pacing in front of Benjamin. Benjamin was sure she was going to hit him at that moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are being so selfish. You don&rsquo;t understand why I&rsquo;m upset because you&rsquo;re being so selfish!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t understand because I&rsquo;m here to find the key so that I can go home. That is selfish, yes. But, isn&rsquo;t that what I&rsquo;m here to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It is, Benjamin. It is. You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Benjamin said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to continue walking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What about King Zwirn?&rdquo; Selma called out to Benjamin as he walked away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; Benjamin answered without pausing his pace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You could save him,&rdquo; she stated as a matter of fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I could save him?&rdquo; Benjamin said as he stopped. &ldquo;Selma, did you see that monster? There is absolutely no way I can save him. Someone bigger than me, maybe. Not me. I&rsquo;d be killed instantly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then what happens to him?&rdquo; Selma asked as Benjamin again continued to walk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said because he honestly didn&rsquo;t know. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He did not want King Zwirn to be hurt, to be imprisoned, or to be alone. But, he did not know what he could do to save him. That monster, Aloysius Trenhaile, was bigger, meaner, and tougher than anything Benjamin could ever dream of being. There was no way that Benjamin could save King Zwirn. If he tried, he risked causing more harm to the king. And certainly, Benjamin thought, Selma would not want that.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;King Bernard Zwirn didn&rsquo;t ask me to save him,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&ldquo;Why did he </span><span class="c4">need</span><span>&nbsp;to ask?&rdquo; Selma responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they were going to walk back to Castle Ehtahl, he had to think of a plan for saving King Zwirn that would make Selma happy. Benjamin worried that she would run back into the castle and try to save him. If Benjamin could not save the king, Selma could not save the king either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he quickened his pace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is this plan?&rdquo; Selma said with an upset tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to go back to the castle and we&rsquo;re going to tell everyone that we found King Zwirn. Then, we&rsquo;ll bring back everyone so that we can all fight Aloysius Trenhaile together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was satisfied with this plan because it made sense to him. He alone could not beat Aloysius Trenhaile but perhaps he and an army could defeat the monster and its army. Even a monster as gargantuan as Aloysius Trenhaile would have difficulty fighting thousands of people. This was, Benjamin decided, a good plan. And, he thought to himself, it meant that he could still go home while knowing that he did his best to help King Zwirn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Selma said. She still had not moved and the gap between Benjamin and Selma grew larger and larger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why not? How do you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to work because no one in the castle is going to leave. They are too scared of that of which we do not talk about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aloysius Trenhaile.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, well, I suppose it might not work. That&rsquo;s a possibility. But, it&rsquo;s a better possibility than me going back into that castle and dying because I tried to destroy a monster five thousand times my strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma didn&rsquo;t respond. She leaned her weight on her right hip and stared into the sky. Benjamin took one glance and thought he saw her muttering something. He couldn&rsquo;t understand what she was saying. And, he couldn&rsquo;t understand why it was so important that he save King Zwirn. Certainly, she did not know Benjamin nearly as well as Benjamin thought he knew himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin continued to walk and felt as if he was making really good time. At this rate, he could get back to the castle in just two days. It would be a difficult two days, he thought to himself, because it would probably be exhausting. But with the key, he thought, I&rsquo;ve got all the motivation I need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same moment Benjamin thought about how the key was motivating him to run back to the castle, Selma sprinted the distance between the two of them and then tackled Benjamin from behind. Benjamin flew about ten feet into the air and then fell into the ground, the key flying into the air. He was more surprised than hurt. In fact, Selma had tackled him in such a way that he was completely uninjured. He was simply shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked in surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selma stood and pinned him to the ground. She held his arms down on his side and stared straight into his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are going to save the king,&rdquo; she said sternly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you should? You&rsquo;re obviously stronger than I am,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he tried to wriggle free. It could not be done. Selma was definitely stronger and tougher than he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you are going to do it. I didn&rsquo;t come this far so that we can go back without the king. You are going to save him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why me? Why not you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Selma started as she closed her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch your back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that she was not telling him everything that was running through her head. And, he also knew that he could not expect to make any further progress toward getting back to Castle Ehtahl. Selma was not going to allow it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Benjamin gulped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go die trying to save King Zwirn if that&rsquo;s what you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want,&rdquo; Selma said as she released the boy. &ldquo;But, you know, without the part of you dying. Please don&rsquo;t die in the castle. Don&rsquo;t die, in general. But, you know, please don&rsquo;t die while you&rsquo;re trying to save the king.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to survive,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just do your best,&rdquo; Selma said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma, that&rsquo;s not inspiring. I don&rsquo;t know what that means. I&rsquo;m really scared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You should be scared. Aloysius Trenhaile is a gigantic monster.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right! That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to go see him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Selma said with a more understanding tone. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to either. But trust me, Benjamin. If you save the king, you&rsquo;ll be saving yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin and Selma walked back to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s castle without saying a word to each other. Benjamin&rsquo;s pace was much slower and much less enthusiastic than when he thought he was leaving. For Selma, he decided, he would save King Zwirn. If this was what she wanted and this was what would allow him to go home, this was what he would do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the castle door that they had only recently exited and took a deep breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you need me, I&rsquo;ll be right here,&rdquo; Selma said as she straightened her clothes and readjusted her backpack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Benjamin replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good luck. And, don&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he lowered his head and walked through the door. He would not have bet on him being the winner of this outcome. As far as Benjamin was concerned, he was walking to the end of his life.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6">Chapter 30: In Which There Is A Battle</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin climbed over the wall and then down the other side, without the same enthusiasm he had when he first entered the castle. He sighed when he saw that the army had erupted into all out frenzy. Skeletons were losing limbs. Trolls were stumbling over minotaurs. Ghosts were scaring each other. Dragons were flying into one another. And, lava was falling everywhere. Benjamin took a deep breathe and then let all the air out of his body through his vibrating lips. He was not excited, at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the mayhem and screams and yelling to the start of the staircase. Selma waited outside the castle and as Benjamin scaled the stairs, he saw her. She was watching his every move. And when Benjamin paused to take a break, he saw her waving to him. He waved back as a headless horseman ran by and fell off the staircase into the coal pile below. Benjamin continued his journey upwards as if nothing surprised him anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got to the top, he could see that the nightmare machine had melted thoroughly enough to render it unusable. But, parts of it were still functioning and it looked like it was going to explode. Aloysius Trenhaile was giving orders to all of the beasts around him to save the machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn it off!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Keep it running and save every part!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aloysius!&rdquo; Benjamin heard King Bernard Zwirn yell. &ldquo;You have to stop this immediately. This is no way to behave, brother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; Aloysius yelled. &ldquo;If this doesn&rsquo;t work tonight, it&rsquo;ll work tomorrow. And, you&rsquo;ll witness it then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, Benjamin pushed open the large door to the room which created a slow squealing noise that grabbed everyone&rsquo;s attention. In fact, as soon as Benjamin stood inside, he saw that every creature was looking at him. Aloysius Trenhaile dropped a box of tools on the ground upon seeing the young child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Really? You again? You came back? Did you drop something that you came back for?&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile asked. &ldquo;You have to be so stupid in order to come back here. I let you free. I didn&rsquo;t chase after you. And now, what? What do you want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin paused and twisted his foot into the ground. He let out a long sigh and thought really hard about why he had returned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh you must be kidding me,&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile said with a chuckle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here because you want to stop me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin continued to twist his foot in the ground and then he began stretching his arms. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what was going to happen next. Benjamin had never fought anyone in his life. He never wanted to fight anyone. It was not in his character. Through his entire life to date, he had always received the insults and punches. He never delivered them. And so, he didn&rsquo;t quite know what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aloysius Trenhaile!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled. &ldquo;Stop the nightmares now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloysius Trenhaile laughed. There was a long silence And then, all of the beasts around him laughed. And then, all of the beasts and nightmares throughout the castle laughed. But there were two people other than Benjamin who were not laughing. King Bernard Zwirn looked scared for Benjamin. And upon looking outside, Selma was still waving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Child, leave now before you get hurt,&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m getting myself into. But, I know that I want you to stop what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And what if I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to have to stop you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roars of laughter spread throughout the castle over and over. Benjamin did not look like a threat. He knew this. He knew this his entire life. But all of that perception was going to change. If Aloysius Trenhaile was not going to stop, Benjamin wanted to stop him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright everyone,&rdquo; Aloysius Trenhaile said to all the beasts. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to saving this nightmare machine. Cool the rest of the melting sections and then--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloysius Trenhaile continued to give instructions to his followers as Benjamin continued to stand there. Benjamin turned to King Bernard Zwirn and saw that he did not look as scared as he did moments before. Instead, the king clench his fist and held it in front of him to give Benjamin his sign of support. And so, Benjamin decided that it was time for him to take things into his own hands. Because if he was going to get hurt, he was willing to get hurt knowing that he could save dreamers like himself everywhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and upon opening his eyes watched a gigantic lava ball smash into the nightmare machine destroying everything that Aloysius Trenhaile was trying to preserve. Unlike before, the beasts and creatures did not respond with panic or confusion. Everyone looked at Benjamin who was imagining another lava ball falling into all of these demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one quick motion, Aloysius Trenhaile pushed everyone away to the walls as a lava ball crashed into the room resulting in a fantastic explosion. Aloysius Trenhaile made a motion with his hands and froze the explosion as it occurred. Benjamin&rsquo;s jaw dropped as he watched Aloysius take the explosion and throw it thousands of feet in the air. They were fighting, Benjamin thought.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin imagined destroying the walls on all sides of the room so that they stood on only a floor on top of the tower. Aloysius responded by creating a large crack in the ground that splintered through Benjamin&rsquo;s feet. Benjamin jumped to the side and watched a chunk of the tower fall to the ground. He picked up some of the boulders and threw them one after another at Aloysius. Aloysius collected them in midair and then threw them back at Benjamin who ducked to the ground to avoid them. This was not going to be as easy as Benjamin thought. Aloysius could imagine things as well as Benjamin could.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Aloysius did something that Benjamin did not expect. He transformed into a gigantic bull. Benjamin started to build a wall in front of him as quickly as he could. Aloysius breathed fire out of his snout and then proceeded to run forward. Benjamin built and built and built until the wall was twenty feet high and twenty feet thick. And still, Aloysius charged through it like it was a stack of cards. Benjamin fell to the ground and slid to the edge of the floor. He held on tightly so as not to fall off the tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He imagined a lightning bolt shattering the sky and hitting Aloysius square in the back. The bull squealed in pain and Aloysius transformed back into a human body. The evil man gathered a fire and set the entire floor ablaze. Benjamin responded by freezing everything around him and then freezing the entire top half of the tower. Aloysius roared in response and then transformed into a cyclops a dozen times larger than Benjamin. He grabbed a section of the building and slammed it over Benjamin. But Benjamin imagined himself in a solid sphere and the tower broke all around him. Aloysius charged and then created a sound wave with his hands that blew Benjamin off the tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was in freefall and could feel that he was losing control. He spun every which direction and did not know how much further he had until he hit the ground. But then he imagined that like that day in the academy, he could fly. And so Benjamin returned to the top of the tower flying and imagined a tornado headed directly for Aloysius. Aloysius responded with a hail storm that absorbed the tornado and tried to suck Benjamin inside it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloysius transformed into a dragon and began chasing Benjamin in the air while sending fireballs in his direction. Benjamin dodged each one and flew throughout the castle, trying to get away from the beast. He circled the tower over and over but Aloysius kept on his tail the entire way. Aloysius snapped at Benjamin with his teeth whenever he neared but Benjamin continued to avoid the monster. He imagined that Aloysius was stuck in an iron cage and when that cage appeared around the flying dragon, Aloysius fell to the ground with a thud loud enough to create another lava river running through the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked down and thought that he did it. He had defeated Aloysius Trenhaile. The monster had fallen to its own demise. Benjamin quickly flew to the top of the tower to find King Bernard Zwirn. He was a little shaken but he was fine. Benjamin opened the cage and let him free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, Benjamin,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the king said slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone could say they felt OK after having survived what you and my brother just created. But, I&rsquo;m fine. We have to leave, Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned to go and then Benjamin saw a sight that was familiar to him from long ago. When he was with his friends, the dinosaurs, trying to stop Professor Undutois from destroying the planet, there was a terrifying monster. It was a monster so feared that the dinosaurs ran from it. A monster that ruined his dreams and turned them into nightmares. And at that moment, Benjamin saw that same monster jump up the side of the tower and land at the very top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower couldn&rsquo;t take the weight of this enormous beast. It swayed from side to side as another chunk of the tower fell to the ground. A crack rippled through the ground to the top floor. The monster looked at Benjamin and let out a roar so loud it could be heard throughout the entire land Benjamin had travelled. Benjamin couldn&rsquo;t hear. The noise was so deafening. And the resulting ringing in his ears made him dizzy. He looked around and saw that King Bernard Zwirn was holding his ears and laying on the ground. He was alive but like Benjamin in a lot of danger. The monster roared again and then snapped at Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wants to cut off my head, Benjamin thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he thought about the last person who wanted to cut off his head, he thought he knew how to destroy this monster. But to do so, he would have to dream of something so massive that the beast couldn&rsquo;t stand a chance. And so, he transformed into a humongous white dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin knew what he was going to do next. He flew into the air and Aloysius gave chase. They flew around the castle several times as Aloysius continued to try to grab and thrash at the white dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been on a basket flown by a bird, he knew that one way to get the bird to fall to the ground was to hit it on the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Throw something at him!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled to King Bernard Zwirn as he flew by the top of the tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin led the monster around the top of the tower several times until he saw King Bernard Zwirn had a ball of fire ready to throw at it. When the king released it, the fire struck the beast in the side. And that alone was not enough to stop it. But, it reacted with confusion and pain. It shook the fire off its body but while it was doing so, Benjamin flew as fast as he could at the monster&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needed to prevent the beast from being able to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he remembered the coal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took as much coal as he could and thrust it at the monster&rsquo;s eyes. The beast screamed in pain and in the middle of the sky, it transformed back into Aloysius Trenhaile. Benjamin thought about letting Aloysius fall to the ground but seeing that he was unconscious, he grabbed him before he fell.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>This was it.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>At the top of the tower, King Bernard Zwirn restrained his brother who at that point was weakened and could no longer fight back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower started to crumble. Benjamin took the king and Aloysius and flew them to where Selma stood outside the castle. As he flew over the wall, the tower completely collapsed and buried all of the monsters and nightmares that were living below. There was nothing left but walls that surrounded a gigantic mound of dust and lava.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re alive,&rdquo; Selma said rather cooly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I survived,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he lay on the grass, exhausted by it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not to say I didn&rsquo;t think you could do it, but I&rsquo;m a little impressed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A little?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re alive. I actually am quite impressed with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But did you really have to bring him back with you?&rdquo; Selma asked as she pointed to the still unconscious Aloysius Trenhaile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking him back with us,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn said. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be producing nightmares any longer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin reached inside his pocket and felt for a key. It was still there. Despite all of the flying and falling and fire and ice and lightning and earthquakes, he still managed to have the key. He could finally leave. And, he could finally leave knowing that Selma was happier with how he was leaving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How did you and your brother grow so far apart?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. &ldquo;You make dreams and he makes nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t always make nightmares,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn said as they prepared themselves for the journey back to Castle Ehtahl. &ldquo;No one wants to be evil. Something happens that makes good people do evil things. My brother originally made dreams. He made some of the most beautiful, inspiring dreams you could ever imagine for people. But one day, everything changed for him. He wanted something he couldn&rsquo;t have. And when he realized he couldn&rsquo;t have it, he started getting angry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What did he want?&rdquo; Selma asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He wanted to always live in a dream. It&rsquo;s one thing to have dreams and be a dreamer. But, we can&rsquo;t live in our dreams. We have to accept that reality is separate from them. He couldn&rsquo;t understand it and he believed that there were people who lived in dreams. And since he was unable to live this way, he decided that no one else should either. That&rsquo;s when he joined the castles that produce nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you going to do with him now?&rdquo; Benjamin asked. &ldquo;His castle&rsquo;s destroyed. He can&rsquo;t produce nightmares there anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t but he could go somewhere else, if he wants. If I know my brother, he&rsquo;s as stubborn as I am. And so, I&rsquo;d like to keep him in Castle Ehtahl for a while. I think if there&rsquo;s anyone who can convince him to change his ways, it&rsquo;ll be me. I can&rsquo;t send him back out into this land. The land will either kill him or he&rsquo;ll hurt others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin respected King Bernard Zwirn for not giving up on his brother. He thought it was commendable that he was going to try to change him to be good. At home, he didn&rsquo;t think most people behaved the same way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So now there&rsquo;s no more nightmares,&rdquo; Benjamin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Selma started. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more nightmares from Aloysius Trenhaile.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to get rid of all the nightmares, Benjamin,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn said as the sun started to rise in the distance. &ldquo;So long as there are dreamers, there are going to be people who want to destroy dreams. The victory today is that there will be more dreams than nightmares. And for your New York, that means there will be dreams again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched the sun rise and felt that he was fine with this situation. He could dream again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; King Bernard Zwirn said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m exhausted.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.ewvrf6fmix0t"></a><span>Chapter 31: In Which There Is A Guard</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they returned to Castle Ehtahl&rsquo;s walls, Benjamin felt relief knowing that he had finally made it back. Selma and he were exhausted. Aloysius Trenhaile was still unconscious. But, King Bernard Zwirn seemed as energetic as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Before we go inside,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;You should probably know that Thalia Nachamie is in charge and he isn&rsquo;t really fond of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Benjamin,&rdquo; the king said. &ldquo;I will clear up everything in the castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Benjamin said as the king was about to pound on the wall. &ldquo;Also, I was wondering if you could clear everything up at Castle Ehtsetra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king froze and looked at Selma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened at Castle Ehtsetra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing really but the queen there doesn&rsquo;t appear to like us either,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;She wanted to cut Benjamin&rsquo;s head off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king let out a loud sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll clear that up as well,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he could pound on the door for the second time, Benjamin interrupted him again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh also,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;You should probably talk to Myrna Delacourte.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king looked at Selma and Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where have you two been over the past week?&rdquo; he asked with disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been to a lot of places.

You don&rsquo;t have to worry about a thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Bernard Zwirn pounded on the castle wall as loudly as he could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Noel Jaffin asked on the other end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, this is King Zwirn.

And, I&rsquo;m five feet tall and cleanly shaven.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stepped forward and pounded on the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, let us in!&rdquo; Benjamin yelled as loudly as he could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pause on the other end. Benjamin could hear feet shuffling around and then a ladder being rested against the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin? Is that you?&rdquo; Noel Jaffin whispered quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, so you recognize Benjamin&rsquo;s voice but you don&rsquo;t recognize mine,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he rolled his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry about that, King Zwirn,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin said as the doors to the castle began to open. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been getting so many visitors who claim to be you. Some of them sounded nearly identical to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;None of them did,&rdquo; Cole said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, not exactly but they were certainly very close to how King Zwirn speaks,&rdquo; Noel Jaffin defended himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;None of them were close,&rdquo; Joel said with a long sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say exactly but I&rsquo;m saying that they could have been mistaken for King Zwirn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, you need to get your ears checked,&rdquo; King Zwirn said as he reentered his castle.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin followed behind and was happy to be in a place that was more hospitable than some of the other places he had been. Selma walked at his side. He knew that she wanted to smile but that she was holding herself back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel left Cole and Joel to close the door and stumbled his way to Bernard Zwirn&rsquo;s side. He was breathless as he tried to speak to the king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; Noel blurted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was kidnapped, Noel,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said without looking at the sweaty guard. &ldquo;But, now I&rsquo;m back. And, I need to see Thalia Nachamie immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noel stopped working and looked to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why of course,&rdquo; Noel said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go find him. But, what are we going to do with Benjamin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn stopped walking and turned his head slightly to the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean what are we going to do with Benjamin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin saw that Noel was trying to keep the conversation private between the king and himself. Noel moved closer to Bernard Zwirn and stood on his toes so as to speak closer to the king&rsquo;s ear. Bernard Zwirn didn&rsquo;t move so Noel tried to speak as quietly as possible, while watching Benjamin in the corner of his eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a convicted villain,&rdquo; Noel whispered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A convicted villain?&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn blurted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sh! He&rsquo;s right there,&rdquo; Noel whispered back in a panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What has he been convicted of?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stealing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What has he stolen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He stole the missing piece of the dream machine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, the dream machine now works?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it could. It doesn&rsquo;t, though. After Benjamin left, Thalia Nachamie told us that since it had not been used in such a long period of time, it was impossible to figure out where the missing piece actually went.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And Thalia Nachamie is the one who convicted Benjamin of stealing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, he didn&rsquo;t steal it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Noel said slowly as he looked away shyly from Benjamin. &ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noel, did anyone see Benjamin steal anything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you think it is odd that Thalia Nachamie didn&rsquo;t fix the machine? He kicked Benjamin from the castle and then did nothing with the missing piece.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not exactly true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Noel started to speak more slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I kicked Benjamin out of the castle,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said from behind Bernard Zwirn. &ldquo;We had to find you. And so, I sent Benjamin to find you by having him be kicked out of the castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You sent a child to find me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not just any child. He&rsquo;s got a larger imagination than any person I&rsquo;ve ever met. His creativity is beyond my understanding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you wanted me to find King Bernard Zwirn,&rdquo; Benjamin said. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just let me go outside like I wanted all along?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because you would have wanted to come back,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;And, we would have had to let you come back. We couldn&rsquo;t think of another way to find King Bernard Zwirn but for some reason, we all agreed that if anyone could find him, you could find him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin was flabbergasted. He could not believe that this had been arranged. The sun beat steadily upon his face as his heart beat twice as fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I could have been killed out there. I had no idea where I was going and I had no idea what I was doing. What if I had gotten myself killed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; Selma said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>&rdquo;As long as you were able to destroy your fears, you were going to be fine,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And he did find me,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And he was the only one who could possibly find you,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It was in your favor, Benjamin,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &ldquo;Because, we couldn&rsquo;t send you home without King Zwirn&rsquo;s assistance. He&rsquo;s the only one that can let you leave. You would have been stuck here forever unless you found him. There isn&rsquo;t a door outside the castle that takes you back to New York. There isn&rsquo;t a door here, either. The door opened when you defeated your nightmare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin realized at that moment that everything that he had gone through had been a result of his desire to leave. He helped others as he tried to help himself. And in the process, he saw that he was cared for and loved by friends he had known for only a short time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, I can now go home?&rdquo; Benjamin asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said as he knelt down to the young boy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done an amazing thing, Benjamin. No one else would have been able to do what you&rsquo;ve done. You&rsquo;ve given us the chance to dream again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Benjamin started to say as he glanced at Selma. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to leave anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to leave?&rdquo; Selma yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to leave! You realize everything we did was to give you a chance to leave! And now, you don&rsquo;t want to leave?&rdquo; Selma screamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard Zwirn physically restrained the young girl from tackling Benjamin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that,&rdquo; Benjamin said shyly. &ldquo;I like it here. I want to see my parents. But, I like it here. I like you all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, great,&rdquo; Selma said sarcastically. &ldquo;He likes us now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do! I do like you. You are my friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin,&rdquo; King Zwirn said. &ldquo;You need to go back and take care of your parents. And, you need to take care of your brother. If we are going to continue to make dreams, we need people to dream.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at the ground and wondered how he could go back to New York now. He had been through so much that had made him happier and braver than he was before. But when he thought of his parents, he knew that the decision was not a difficult one. He had to go back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find Russell Fox,&rdquo; Bernard Zwirn said. &ldquo;When you are ready to leave, let me know Benjamin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going as well,&rdquo; Miss Lindenmeyer said, referring to Pritchett Pollock. &ldquo;We will see you soon. You can come back whenever you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye, Benjamin,&rdquo; Pritchett Pollock said. &ldquo;Please try to keep your dreams a little less creative. You&rsquo;re stretching my budget.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin watched them leave and wondered when he would see them again. He wondered when he would see the production studios. And then, he wondered if he would ever see Snark again. Rodney! He never met Rodney Cohen and still did not know anything about him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Benjamin said reluctantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just like that?&rdquo; Selma said quietly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to even fight to stay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he saw water well in her eyes or if she was squinting her face in anger, but in either case Selma looked hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, you just told me--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know what I told you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I guess I expected that you&rsquo;d spend a little over five minutes thinking about staying. But, you&rsquo;re ready to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, my parents--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Selma said. &ldquo;You should go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But Selma--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Selma!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin grabbed her and hugged her as hard as he could. He was hugging her so hard that he worried he had squeezed all of the air from her little body. He released her a little bit but when he felt Selma hug him back, he squeezed her again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you,&rdquo; she said quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you, too,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And if you tell anyone I said that I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; she yelled as she ran away.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c1"><a name="h.vn60bvzgqmk2"></a><span>Chapter 32: In Which There Is A Dinosaur</span></h1><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Buckingham drove over a hundred miles an hour through the neighborhood, careful not to run into any pigeons and squirrels walking across the street. Her eyes were focused on the road like a racecar driver searching for a finish line. The news reporter on the radio was going on and on about the same story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In a report issued last night, people everywhere are dreaming again,&rdquo; the reporter said. &ldquo;The dreams are back and people are more confident than ever. For more on this story, we&rsquo;re turning to field reporter Rebecca--&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why every morning has to be like this,&rdquo; she said to Benjamin who sat silently in the passenger seat. Benjamin bounced the back of his head against his seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear my alarm,&rdquo; Benjamin said quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You say that every morning,&rdquo; Mrs. Buckingham said as she swerved around a group of squirrels fighting over a nut. &ldquo;And every morning I have to race through the neighborhood giving all the little critters along the way heart attacks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can be late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You cannot be late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, Billy comes in late almost every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t Billy. You missed too much class already what with your having disappeared for so long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin heard a pigeon scream as it narrowly missed being struck by their little car.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it up. No big deal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No big deal? Benjamin, we still have to talk about where you were. This is a big deal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Buckingham slammed on the brakes and stopped at a red light. Benjamin flew forward and nearly hit his head on the dashboard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we learn anything at school anyways,&rdquo; Benjamin said matter of factly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Buckingham stared at him with accusing eyes for about a minute. Benjamin didn&rsquo;t know why she didn&rsquo;t agree. He learned more in the past month than he had in all of his days in Mr. Marchetta&rsquo;s classroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin, I love you but sometimes you say the most ridiculous things. When you get home tonight, you have to tell me where you were for the past month,&rdquo; his mother said as she accelerated the car faster and faster through New York.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin wondered how much easier it would have been to get to Aloysius Trenhaile&rsquo;s Castle if he had a car. He assumed, of course, that he knew how to drive. But based on how his mother was currently driving, he decided it could not be that difficult. He then wondered how much sooner he would have gotten home had he had roads to follow like the roads throughout his neighborhood. And then, he wondered how much further he could have travelled each day if there were lights scattered throughout to illuminate his path. There were things everywhere along this race to school that made Benjamin wonder whether he could have endured less in his voyage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at that moment when a squirrel jumped over the car to avoid Mrs. Buckingham&rsquo;s dash to the finish line, he knew that it would all be different. If he had things that could have made his journey easier, he would not have evolved from the boy who was scared of everything into the boy who was scared of a lot less.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye, mom,&rdquo; Benjamin said as he exited the car in front of the school as she waved goodbye and blew him a kiss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school looked the same. Nothing had changed. It had a boring exterior. The grass was barely alive. Kids trampled over each other to get through the door before the bell rang. It was exactly as it was. There was nothing different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Benjamin loved that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because for the first time in his life, he knew that he was different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that meant that possibly, just possibly, he was not below average.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in Mr. Marchetta&rsquo;s classroom as the teacher lectured over and over again about forests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Forests have lots of animals in them. There are deer, birds, raccoons, all sorts of animals. The only animal you don&rsquo;t find in a forest is people. We don&rsquo;t live in forests. We live in cities. Forests don&rsquo;t have toilets or grocery stores or movie theaters. You think it&rsquo;s funny but if you ever decide to spend some time in a forest, you&rsquo;ll learn it&rsquo;s not an enjoyable place. You&rsquo;re going to want to leave. Forests are the worst. They are scary and ruthless and dangerous. There&rsquo;s nothing fun about a forest. But if you find yourself in a forest, make sure to mark trees with a rock as you walk. That way, you&rsquo;ll know how to exit. You just search for the trees that you marked. And then, you&rsquo;ll be on your way out unless...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin stared out the window and watched a large billowing cloud takes its time moving along the blue canvas of the sky toward the golden sun resting above the buildings across the street. He saw Mr. Marchetta&rsquo;s fancy car parked outside the school. It was blue and looked like it would move much faster than his mother&rsquo;s car. He didn&rsquo;t like it. Part of the reason he didn&rsquo;t like it was because it was owned by Mr. Marchetta. But, the other part that he didn&rsquo;t like was that it looked out of place. He wanted to see a tree or a bush or a river or a volcano instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then suddenly, Benjamin saw Snark appear from seemingly out of nowhere. Benjamin&rsquo;s heart raced and his eyes widened as he stretched his neck to see what Snark was going to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground vibrated with each step Snark took, pounding the pavement and rattling the windows. Snark paused and turned his gigantic head. Benjamin knew Snark was looking directly at him. Snark&rsquo;s mouth opened slightly to reveal his teeth and Benjamin saw him pant lightly like a dog when it&rsquo;s happy.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Benjamin grinned as well.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>Snark lifted his left leg high into the air and then slammed it down into Mr. Marchetta&rsquo;s car. It made the same sound as when Benjamin stepped on an empty soda can. And since Benjamin liked that sound so much, it was impossible for him to not stop laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snark left as quickly as he arrived but not without waving to Benjamin beforehand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Benjamin!&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin covered his mouth and then turned to his teacher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I asked you a question! Why weren&rsquo;t you paying attention?&rdquo; Mr. Marchetta asked with a stern, angry look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because he still doesn&rsquo;t know where he is,&rdquo; Howard Horne snickered from the back. &ldquo;Benjamin&rsquo;s lost in the forest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class, Howard Horne&rsquo;s audience, giggled in response. Mr. Marchetta started to laugh as well. Benjamin looked around and saw that he was the joke of everyone around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike weeks ago when Benjamin was bullied and felt like there was nothing outside of that classroom for him, he knew that there was a big world ready to welcome him. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He didn&rsquo;t need the bullies.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>He had his friends.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span>And so, he smiled.</span></p></body></html>
