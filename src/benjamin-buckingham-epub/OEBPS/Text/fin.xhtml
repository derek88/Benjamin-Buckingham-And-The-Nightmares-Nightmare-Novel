<p>For Kristin Colarusso</p>

<p>Did you finish the book? Wow! Really? That's Awesome! You're like a superhero right now! I wrote this book with one goal: get 100 kids to read it. If you happen to know someone who might enjoy this book, would you let that person know?</p>

<p>Also, please email me at gregory.gershwin@gmail.com and let me know what you thought of the book.</p>

<p>I graduated from Brown University with a degree in English Literature, worked for years at a large book publisher, and dreamed in New York City.</p>

<p>Thank you to Adrian Moore for editing and Alicia Vergel de Dios for illustrating. Also, thank you to Dan Bergstein, Tim McCormick, Matthew Hooban, Charlie Sneath, Jessica Chen, Lindsey Weaver, Ned Rust, and Martina for reading various different drafts. And, thank you to Aaron Uhrmacher, George Abbott, Michael Lupo, Winnie Kwan, Shan Ma, Michael Anderson, Chinmay Bijwe, Scott Albrecht, and Kate Veronneau for general advice and support over the course of the project. And, my family.</p>
