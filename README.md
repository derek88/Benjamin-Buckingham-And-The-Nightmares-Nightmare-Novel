### About

Benjamin Buckingham And The Nightmare's Nightmare is a children's novel I wrote between 2013 and 2014. I published the book on December 16, 2014. In early 2014, I decided to move my entire creative process to git (a reversion control management tool that manages the changes made in files) so I could record the evolution of the book throughout the creative process. This tool allowed me to funnel my creative energies into a process that encouraged me to always look forward and to make incremental changes. It also allowed me to see how far I had come and how far I had yet to go.

I am now opening this GitHub repo to the public since the book has been made available in electronic form on both [Amazon Kindle] and [Barnes & Noble Nook]. I would very much appreciate if you would read the book and post a review online.

But, why am I making this book public?

I am opening my creative process so that other writers, artists, lovers-of-stories, and engineers can see how I used git to create this work. You are able to see the efforts of a year of thinking, planning, creating, writing, editing, copyediting, copyediting again, formatting, and publishing. Imagine it as a behind-the-scenes, archealogical exploration of the history of the book.

You can see when
- Plot decisions were made.
- When characters were created.
- Or removed.
- Or changed personalities.
- When I deleted chapters.
- When I added chapters.
- When I made revisions.
- Or when those revisions needed to be reversed.
- When my readers offered feedback.
- And my unfiltered thoughts about that feedback.
- When I grew as a writer.
- And when I was stagnant.
- Or when I just didn't yet know where the book was going.
- Or whether a character was being too whiny.
- Or too proud.
- Or too loud.
- Or obnoxious.
- Or didn't have friends.
- And when he got friends.
- And how much fun he had with those friends.

I had a lot of fun writing the book with git and I would like to share the result with you. GitHub.com has a nice user interface that allows you do some cool things.

For example, 
- Visit the commit history and see when changes were made. Some characters appeared, disappeared, or changed along the creative process.
- Take a diff (difference) of two commits and see what changed during that time.
- Look at the graphs to see when changes were made.
- Observe how I made copyediting and story changes in the commit history.
- Tell me (gregory [dot] gershwin [@] gmail [dot] com) what else you find intriguing.

And if you happen to know a thing about git, perhaps you'd like to make some changes to the repo. Here are some suggestions for how you could add to it:
- See a spelling mistake in the book? Send me a pull request and I'll merge it.
- Any grammatical mistakes? Pull request!
- Think some sentences were clunky or could have been better written? I'd love a pull request for that as well to see what you think. I may not merge it but it would be a fun exercise to see the difference in writing styles.

My goal for opening this repo to the public is to share my creative process. In addition, I hope you do read the book and if you like it, you share it with others and review it online. Ideally, I'd like to continue writing and share more creative processes in the future. I can only do so if I have some readers.

Have fun and let me know what you discover.
